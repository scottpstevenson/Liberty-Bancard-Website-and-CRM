    {
      label: "Email 1 — Day 1",
      subject: "Auto shops on Square or Clover are overpaying — here's the math",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

If your auto shop is running on Square or Clover, you're likely paying 2.6–2.75% on every transaction — including your biggest repair invoices.

On a $2,500 transmission job, that's $65 in processing fees. On a $4,000 brake and suspension job, it's $110. Multiply that across your monthly volume and it's a significant line item on your P&L.

At Liberty Bancard, we've helped dozens of independent auto shops cut that cost:

✓ Interchange-plus pricing — dramatically lower on large, high-ticket invoices
✓ Cash discount / dual-pricing program — eliminate your processing fees entirely
✓ Free modern terminal or integration with your shop management software
✓ Same-day or next-day funding — critical when you're fronting parts costs
✓ No long-term contract required

For a shop doing $70K/month in card volume, switching from 2.65% flat to interchange-plus saves $400–$700/month. The cash discount option can push that to $1,500+/month.

      label: "Email 2 — Day 4 Follow-Up",
      subject: "Auto shop processing — the cash discount angle",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

One thing I didn't highlight in my first email: for auto shops, the cash discount program is often the biggest win.

Customers paying by credit card see a price that includes the processing cost built in. Customers paying cash get a discount (typically 3–4%). The net result is that your processing cost drops to near zero — legally, and with full card-brand approval.

Many shops we work with eliminate $1,000–$2,500/month in processing fees with this structure.

Forward your last processing statement to {{agentEmail}} and I'll show you exactly what both options — interchange-plus and cash discount — would look like for your volume.

      subject: "Last note for {{businessName}} — processing cost review",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

I'll wrap up here — I know you're busy running the shop.

Most independent auto shops are paying $500–$1,500/month more than they need to in processing fees, primarily because Square and Clover use flat-rate pricing that isn't optimized for large repair invoices.

If that number sounds meaningful to your business, I'm happy to run the comparison for free: {{agentEmail}}

  MedSpa: [

      subject: "Med spas on Square or Stripe are losing $700–$2,500/month — here's why",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

Med spas run some of the highest average ticket sizes in the service industry — Botox, filler, laser treatments, and membership packages at $300–$1,500 per visit. That makes your payment processor choice one of the highest-impact financial decisions in your business.

If you're using Square or Stripe at 2.6–2.9% flat, you're paying the same rate on a $1,200 Sculptra appointment as you would on a $10 coffee.

At Liberty Bancard, we build payment programs specifically for med spas:

✓ Interchange-plus pricing — lower effective rate on high-ticket treatments
✓ Cash discount program — shift processing cost to card-paying clients
✓ Membership and package recurring billing — tokenized, PCI-compliant
✓ Chargeback protection for prepaid treatment packages
✓ Integration with Jane, Vagaro, Mindbody, Zenoti, and Aesthetic Record
✓ Same-day funding

Med spas doing $80K–$150K/month typically save $700–$2,500/month after switching.

      subject: "Med spa cash discount — the $2,000/month opportunity",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

For med spas specifically, the cash discount program is often the highest-ROI move.

A practice doing 150 treatments at an average $700 ticket runs $105K/month through their processor. At 2.7% flat, that's $2,835/month in fees. With a properly structured cash discount program, that cost shifts to card-paying clients — your effective cost drops to near zero.

That $2,835/month could fund a new laser head, cover a part-time esthetician's salary, or simply improve your margin on every appointment.

Send your last processing statement to {{agentEmail}} and I'll put together a complete side-by-side within 24 hours.

Wrapping up here — I know your inbox is full.

The short version: if your med spa is doing $80K+/month in card volume on Square or Stripe, there's likely $700–$2,500/month in savings available through better pricing or a cash discount program.

  Jewelry: [

      label: "Email 1 — Day 1",
      subject: "Jewelry retailers: First Data and Fiserv are expensive — there's a better option",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

Jewelry stores have some of the highest average transaction values in retail — and that makes your choice of payment processor a high-stakes decision. If you're on First Data, Fiserv, or a similar legacy processor, you're likely paying bundled or tiered rates that don't reflect the true interchange cost on your high-value sales.

At Liberty Bancard, we specialize in high-ticket retail:

✓ Interchange-plus pricing — transparent, no hidden markups on premium cards
✓ Cash discount / dual-pricing program — shift processing cost to card-paying customers
✓ High-limit authorization support for large purchases ($5K–$50K)
✓ Chargeback protection — critical for high-value item disputes
✓ Same-day funding so your cash flow matches your sales pace

For a jewelry retailer doing $120K/month in card volume, the difference between 2.8% bundled and interchange-plus can be $800–$1,400/month. The cash discount option can add another $1,500–$2,500/month back to the business.

      subject: "Jewelry retail processing — cash discount + high-ticket auth",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

Two things worth highlighting specifically for jewelry retail:

1. Cash discount program: On a $3,000 diamond ring, a 3.5% processing fee is $105. A properly structured cash discount program shifts that cost to card-paying customers — entirely legally. Most jewelry stores implementing this recover $1,500–$3,000/month in what were previously processing fees.

2. High-ticket authorization support: Sales over $5K require specific authorization handling to minimize declines and downgrade risks. We configure this correctly from day one.

      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

This is my last note — I don't want to be a nuisance.

The short version: if your jewelry store is doing $80K+/month in card volume on First Data, Fiserv, or a similar legacy processor, there is almost certainly $800–$2,000/month in savings available — either through better pricing, a cash discount program, or both.

  Veterinary: [

      label: "Email 1 — Day 1",
      subject: "Vet practices on VetPay or Square are usually overpaying — here's the math",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

Veterinary practices deal with a unique payment mix: emergency visits with large, unexpected invoices, routine care, and an increasing share of premium rewards credit cards — which carry some of the highest interchange rates in the industry.

If you're processing through VetPay, Square, or your practice management software's built-in payments, you're likely on a flat rate of 2.6–3.2%.

At Liberty Bancard, we work with independent vet practices and specialty animal hospitals:

✓ Interchange-plus pricing — optimized for your specific transaction mix
✓ Large emergency invoice support — high-ticket authorizations handled correctly
✓ Integration with Avimark, eVetPractice, Cornerstone, and other vet PMS platforms
✓ Same-day funding — critical when you're managing supply and medication costs
✓ No long-term contract required

For a vet practice doing $80K/month in card volume, moving from 2.9% flat to interchange-plus typically saves $500–$900/month.

      subject: "Veterinary practice processing — the premium card problem",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

One thing worth highlighting for vet practices specifically:

Your clients are increasingly paying with premium rewards credit cards (Chase Sapphire, Amex Platinum, etc.). These cards carry some of the highest interchange rates in the system — often 2.3–2.5% just for interchange before processor markup.

On a flat-rate processor at 2.75%, you're paying about the same whether the card is a basic debit card or an Amex Gold. With interchange-plus, your debit and standard cards come in significantly cheaper, which brings your blended effective rate down.

For a practice doing $80K/month in cards, that optimization alone is often $400–$700/month.

Forward your last processing statement to {{agentEmail}} and I'll show you exactly where the savings are for your specific card mix.

  Dental: [

      subject: "On $80K/month in dental volume, 3% vs. 2% = $9,600/year — is your practice on the right side?",
      body: `Hi {{firstName}},

Dentrix and Eaglesoft are excellent practice management systems — but their built-in payment processors charge 2.5–3.5% flat rates while interchange-plus pricing delivers the same seamless integration at 1.8–2.1% for most dental card types.

On $80K/month in card transactions, the difference between 3% flat and 2% interchange-plus is $800/month — $9,600 a year back to your practice.

At Liberty Bancard, we integrate with Dentrix, Eaglesoft, and all major dental practice management platforms without changing your front-desk workflow:

✓ Interchange-plus pricing — no bundled flat rates, full transparency
✓ Drop-in integration with Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Carestream, and others
✓ Patient payment plan billing — recurring, built in, no extra cost
✓ HSA/FSA card support
✓ Same-day funding

Quick number: on $80K/month in card volume, the difference between 3% flat (the rate most dental software processors charge) and 2% interchange-plus is $800/month — or $9,600 a year.

Most practices we work with were paying that gap without realizing it. The switch takes about a day and doesn't change your front-desk workflow in Dentrix or Eaglesoft — we integrate directly.

I'll keep this short — this is my last note on the subject.

If your practice is processing $60K–$100K/month through your dental software's built-in payment system, there's a very good chance you're paying $600–$1,000/month more than you need to.

The math is simple, the switch is painless (we integrate with your PMS directly), and the analysis is completely free.

## OPENING (30 seconds)

"Hi {{firstName}}, this is {{agentName}} from Liberty Bancard — thanks for taking a few minutes. Real quick, I want to make sure this is worth your time before we dive in. Do you currently accept credit and debit cards at your business?"

[Yes] → "Great. And roughly how much volume are you running through your processor each month? Ballpark is fine."

[Get a number] → "Perfect. And do you know offhand what your current effective rate is — meaning the actual percentage you're paying after all fees, not just the advertised rate?"

- If they know: note it and proceed.
- If they don't know: "No worries — most merchants don't. That's actually what I'm going to show you today."

---

## STATEMENT REVIEW (2 minutes)

"So here's the thing — most processors quote you one rate, but when you add up all the fees on your statement, the real number is usually 0.3% to 1% higher than what you think you're paying."

"For example, if you're on 2.6% flat and your actual effective rate after all fees is 3.2%, on $[their monthly volume] a month, that gap alone is $[calculate: volume × 0.006]/month — or $[annualize] a year."

**CALCULATION:** volume × (real rate – ideal rate) = monthly savings. Annualize × 12.

## THE COMPARISON (1 minute)

"Here's how our pricing works. We use interchange-plus pricing — that means you pay the actual Visa/Mastercard interchange rate plus a small, fixed markup. No bundled rates, no tiered surprises."

"For a business like yours, our all-in effective rate would typically run about:"
- Retail / Auto Shop: 1.9–2.3%
- Restaurant: 2.0–2.4%
- Healthcare / Dental / Vet: 1.8–2.2%
- Jewelry / High-ticket: 1.7–2.1%
- Med Spa: 1.8–2.2%

"And if you're open to a cash discount or dual-pricing program, we can get your net processing cost to near zero — legally, with full card-brand approval."

## THE CLOSE (30 seconds)

**If engaged and motivated:**
"The easiest next step is to forward me your last processing statement. I'll do the full analysis overnight and send you a side-by-side comparison. Takes you 2 minutes. Does that work?"

**If interested but cautious:**
"I'm not going to push you to make any decisions today. Let me just show you the numbers — if it makes sense, great; if not, at least you'll know exactly what you're paying. Can we get 10 minutes on the calendar this week?"

**If wants to think about it:**
"Totally understand. One quick question before I let you go — is it the timing that's not right, or is there something specific that would need to change for this to make sense?"`;

    reply: "What's your early termination fee? Because if we can save you $400–$800 a month, even a $495 ETF pays for itself in 30–60 days. Most merchants who switch mid-contract are cash-flow positive by month two. Can I run the breakeven on your statement?",

    title: "I'm happy with my current processor.",

    reply: "That's great — I'm not here to create a problem where there isn't one. But here's the thing: most merchants who tell me they're happy haven't looked at their effective rate in over a year. If an independent review confirms you're on good pricing, you'll know for sure. If it doesn't — you'll have missed $600–$1,200/month you could have kept. Would you let me do a 24-hour analysis, no strings attached?",
  },
  {
    title: "Your rates seem about the same as what I'm paying now.",
    reframe: "They're comparing advertised rates, not effective rates. The gap between the two is where merchants lose the most money.",
    reply: "The advertised rate is almost never the real number. What you're actually paying is your effective rate — that's total fees divided by total volume on your statement. Most merchants think they're at 2.5% and find out they're actually at 3.1–3.4% when you include all the fees. I can calculate your exact effective rate from your last statement in under 24 hours. Want me to show you the real number?",

  {
    title: "I need to talk to my partner / accountant first.",
    reframe: "This is a legitimate request, not a brush-off. Make it easy for them to have the conversation by giving them the right materials.",
    reply: "Absolutely — I'd encourage that. Would it help if I put together a one-page savings summary showing your current effective rate versus what you'd pay with us, plus the annual dollar difference? Something concrete they can review without having to ask you to remember the details. That way the conversation is about the numbers, not the concept.",
  },
  {
    title: "I already tried switching processors once — it was a hassle.",
    reframe: "They had a bad experience and are risk-averse. Validate the experience, then differentiate your process.",
    reply: "That's completely fair — a bad setup experience can cost you days of disruption. What went wrong last time? [Listen.] Here's what we do differently: we handle the equipment setup, merchant account transfer, and software integration. Your team doesn't have to touch the technical side. Most switches go live within 48–72 hours, and we do a same-day call after go-live to make sure everything is clean.",
