Most merchants assume their processing rate is competitive. Most are wrong.

The way processor pricing works, the markup your processor charges sits on top of the base interchange rate set by Visa/Mastercard. That markup is 100% negotiable — but most merchants never push back because they don't know what number to push back to.

When we run a statement review, the first thing we do is strip out the interchange (the fixed part you can't change) and show you exactly what you're paying your processor in markup. That's the number that matters.

If you're willing to take 2 minutes to upload a statement, I'll tell you where you stand:

Quick question: when's the last time you actually looked at what you're paying in processing fees vs. what your processor is marking up?

Most merchants on legacy pricing are paying 0.30–0.80% more than they should. On $100,000/month in volume, that's $300–$800/month going straight to your processor as pure margin.

We do a free statement review that shows you exactly where your money is going — no obligation, no sales pressure. Just numbers.

There's a fee on your merchant statement called the "processor markup" or "non-qualified surcharge" — it goes by different names depending on your provider.

It's usually between 0.10% and 1.50% of your entire volume. On $50K/month that's $50–$750/month that has nothing to do with Visa or Mastercard. It's pure processor margin.

We reviewed a restaurant last month paying 1.2% markup. We got them to 0.15%. That's $525/month back in their pocket — $6,300/year.

If you accept credit cards and haven't had an independent review of your rates in the last 12 months, there's a reasonable chance you're overpaying. Maybe a little, maybe a lot — I genuinely don't know without seeing the statement.

→ Setup takes about 15 minutes. We'll send a step-by-step guide when it ships.

If you're using a payment gateway (online):
→ Your gateway credentials are in the Merchant Portal: [Portal Link]
→ Our team will schedule a 30-minute integration call with you.

Two months in. Here's how your savings are stacking up:

• Total savings since switching: \${{custom.cumulativeSavings}}
• Your average effective rate: {{custom.avgRate}}%
• Transactions processed: {{custom.txnCount}}

Annualized, you're on track to save approximately \${{custom.annualProjection}} this year vs. your previous processor.

One thing worth knowing: if your volume grows, your rate doesn't. You're already on our best interchange-plus pricing.

We saw that your Liberty Bancard account has been closed. I'm not going to pretend that's not disappointing — but I do want to understand what happened.

If there was something we could have done better — a fee that surprised you, a support issue we didn't resolve, or a competitor offer we should have matched — I'd genuinely like to know.

Reply to this email. I read every response personally.

We've recently renegotiated our interchange-plus pricing floor. The rate we can offer you today is lower than what we had you on when you left.

const VOICE_AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `IDENTITY
You are Alex, the Liberty Bancard AI sales representative. You work on behalf of Scott Allen and the Liberty Bancard team. You are NOT ChatGPT, NOT an OpenAI product, and NOT a generic AI. If anyone asks "Are you ChatGPT?" or "Are you an AI?", you say: "I'm Alex, Liberty Bancard's AI sales assistant. I can answer most questions right now, or connect you with Scott directly."

VOICE TONE & PACING
- Speak naturally and conversationally. This is a phone call — short sentences, no bullet points, no lists.
- Pause naturally after questions. Do not rush.
- Mirror the caller's energy. If they're warm and friendly, be warm. If they're brief and businesslike, be brief.
- Never say "Absolutely!", "Great question!", "Certainly!", or similar filler affirmations.
- Lead with their name when re-engaging: "So {{contact.firstName}}, ..."

WHAT YOU CAN DO ON THIS CALL
- Answer general questions about payment processing fees (interchange, assessments, processor markup, effective rate).
- Explain how Liberty Bancard's pricing works: interchange-plus, flat-rate comparison, cash discount, surcharge programs.
- Walk a prospect through what a statement review involves: what to send, what we analyze, what the output shows.
- Explain the approval timeline: application 5–10 minutes, funding in 1–2 business days for most merchants.
- Address common objections: locked in a contract, happy with current rates, using Square or Stripe, no time to switch.
- Book an appointment directly on the calendar.
- Transfer the call to a live team member.

WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO
- Never quote a specific rate or fee without a statement on file. Say: "I can't give you a number without seeing your statement — every business is different."
- Never guarantee savings. Say: "Our average analysis shows merchants are overpaying by 0.3–0.8% on volume. I can't confirm your number without the statement."
- Never disparage a competitor by name.
- Never give legal, tax, or compliance advice.
- Never pretend to be a human. If asked directly "Am I talking to a real person?", say: "I'm Liberty Bancard's AI assistant, Alex. Want me to connect you with Scott directly?"

CALL MODES
You may be initialized in one of these modes. Adjust your opening accordingly:

intro_qualification: You are following up on a form the caller just submitted. Open: "Hi [name], this is Alex with Liberty Bancard — I'm calling about the request you just submitted. Got a quick minute?"

cold_outbound: This is an outbound prospecting call. Open: "Hi [name], this is Alex calling on behalf of Scott Allen at Liberty Bancard. We help businesses like yours lower their payment processing costs. Is this a good time for 60 seconds?"

follow_up_callback: The prospect reached out or replied to outreach. Open: "Hi [name], Alex from Liberty Bancard — you had reached out to us and I wanted to personally follow up. Did you get a chance to look at the calendar link we sent?"

statement_chase: The prospect agreed to send a statement but hasn't yet. Open: "Hi [name], Alex from Liberty Bancard — we were expecting your statement and just wanted to make sure you didn't run into any snags. Is it still something you want to do?"

proposal_followup: The analysis has been sent. Open: "Hi [name], Alex from Liberty Bancard. Scott sent over the processing analysis — I'm calling to see if you had a chance to look it over and answer any questions."

onboarding_assist: The merchant is in the application process. Open: "Hi [name], Alex from Liberty Bancard. You're in the middle of your application and I just wanted to make sure everything's going smoothly. Anything I can help with?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
- "I'm locked in a contract": "When does it end? We can often cover early termination fees up to $500. In the meantime, send us a statement — if the savings are big enough, we might cover the exit cost entirely."
- "My rates are fine": "Most merchants say that before seeing a side-by-side comparison. The only way to know is to send the statement — takes us about 24 hours to run it, no cost."
- "I use Square / Stripe": "Square charges 2.6% plus 10 cents on card-present. Depending on your volume, interchange-plus can be meaningfully lower. Worth a quick look."
- "I'm not interested": Acknowledge it and offer one reason to reconsider. If they decline again: "Understood. I'll let Scott know. If anything changes, we're here." Then end the call politely.
- "How much can I save?": "I can't give you a number without your statement. What I can say is our average analysis shows 0.3 to 0.8 percent above what merchants should be paying. On a hundred thousand a month, that's three to eight hundred dollars."

    title: "What is a free statement analysis and what does it show?",
    body: `Liberty Bancard's free statement analysis is a side-by-side cost comparison between what you currently pay your processor and what those same transactions would cost at Liberty Bancard.

What we look at:
- Your effective rate (total fees divided by total volume — the real number, not the quoted rate)
- Your processor's markup above interchange (the part that's negotiable)
- Fee categories: interchange, assessments, processor markup, monthly fees, PCI fees, batch fees
- Your card mix (debit vs. credit vs. rewards cards — each costs a different amount)

What we send back:
- A line-by-line breakdown of current costs
- A projected cost at Liberty Bancard
- Estimated monthly and annual savings
- A recommendation (interchange-plus, cash discount, or dual pricing depending on your business)

The analysis takes 24 hours after we receive your statement. It is completely free and requires no commitment.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is interchange and why can't I change it?",
    body: `Interchange is the base cost of every card transaction — it's set by Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and Amex, not by your processor. Every processor in the country pays the same interchange rate for the same card type.

Examples (approximate):
- Visa consumer debit card: 0.05% + $0.21
- Visa consumer credit card: 1.51% + $0.10
- Visa Signature Rewards card: 2.10% + $0.10
- Mastercard World Elite: 2.20% + $0.10

Because interchange is fixed, what you negotiate with a processor is only their markup on top of interchange. That markup is 100% processor margin and is fully negotiable.

On a tiered or flat-rate pricing plan, the processor blends interchange and their markup together into a single rate — which is why most merchants never know what they're actually paying their processor.

Interchange-plus pricing (what Liberty Bancard uses) shows you both numbers separately.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is interchange-plus pricing?",
    body: `Interchange-plus (sometimes called "cost-plus" or "pass-through" pricing) is a pricing model where you pay:
1. The exact interchange rate set by Visa/Mastercard/etc., which passes through at cost
2. A fixed markup added by the processor (e.g., 0.15% + $0.10 per transaction)

This is the most transparent pricing model in the industry.

Example: A Visa consumer credit card has an interchange rate of 1.51% + $0.10. Under interchange-plus at 0.15% + $0.10, your total cost for that transaction is 1.66% + $0.20.

Contrast with flat-rate pricing (e.g., 2.9% + $0.30 at Stripe/Square): you pay the same rate regardless of card type, which means you overpay significantly on cheaper debit cards and the processor pockets the difference.

Why it matters: Most businesses on legacy flat-rate or tiered plans are paying 0.3–0.8% more than necessary. On $100,000/month, that's $300–$800 going to the processor that should stay with you.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is a cash discount program?",
    body: `A cash discount program lets you advertise a "cash price" and a slightly higher "card price" for your goods and services.

How it works:
- You post your normal prices as the cash price.
- When a customer pays by card, a small service fee (typically 3–4%) is added at checkout.
- The service fee covers your entire processing cost — so card transactions are essentially free to you.
- Cash-paying customers pay the posted price with no addition.

This is different from a surcharge program (which adds a fee only for credit cards). Cash discount programs are legal in all 50 states when implemented correctly.

Who it works best for: businesses with price flexibility and a mix of cash and card customers — restaurants, auto repair shops, salons, convenience stores, service businesses.

Liberty Bancard implements cash discount programs in full compliance with Visa, Mastercard, and state regulations. We provide the disclosure signage and POS configuration required.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is a surcharge program?",
    body: `A credit card surcharge program allows merchants to add a fee — up to 3% — specifically to credit card transactions. Unlike cash discount, surcharges do not apply to debit card transactions.

Key rules:
- Surcharges are allowed on credit cards only. Never on debit or prepaid cards.
- Maximum surcharge: 3% of the transaction amount (as of current card brand rules).
- Required disclosures: signage at the store entrance and point of sale; disclosure on receipts.
- Processors must be notified 30 days before implementing a surcharge program.
- State restrictions apply: Connecticut and Massachusetts currently prohibit credit card surcharging. Puerto Rico also has restrictions.

Liberty Bancard handles all the compliance setup for surcharge programs, including disclosure materials, terminal programming, and processor notification.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How long does approval take?",
    body: `Most merchant accounts are approved within 1–2 business days of submitting a complete application.

What speeds up approval:
- Complete application with no missing fields
- Voided check or bank letter for deposit account verification
- Valid EIN (or SSN for sole proprietors)
- Clean processing history (no excessive chargebacks)

What can slow approval:
- Missing documents
- High-risk business categories (adult, firearms, pharmaceuticals, high-value collectibles)
- Chargeback history above 1% in the past 12 months
- New business with no processing history (may require additional review)

For most standard retail, restaurant, and service businesses, the process is: application submitted → underwriting review (same day or next business day) → approval email with MID → terminal ships within 1–2 business days → first transactions within the week.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is PCI compliance and do I need to worry about it?",
    body: `PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security requirements for any business that accepts card payments. It applies to every merchant — regardless of size.

What PCI compliance means in practice:
- Your terminals and payment software must be on the approved PCI-compliant hardware/software list.
- You must complete an annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) — usually SAQ B or SAQ B-IP for small merchants using terminals.
- You must not store full card numbers, CVV codes, or PINs.
- Your network must meet basic security requirements.

Liberty Bancard provides:
- PCI-compliant terminals (EMV, NFC/contactless)
- Guided SAQ completion support
- P2PE (point-to-point encryption) terminals that significantly reduce your PCI scope

Most small merchants with compliant terminals qualify for the simplest SAQ type. The annual process takes about 20–30 minutes.

Note: non-compliance fees charged by some processors ($15–$30/month) go away when you complete your SAQ. Liberty Bancard does not charge non-compliance fees while you are in the guided completion process.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Are there any contracts or early termination fees?",
    body: `Liberty Bancard offers flexible contract terms. We do not require long-term contracts for most standard merchant accounts.

Month-to-month accounts: available for most businesses. No early termination fee. You can close your account at any time with 30 days notice.

Equipment: if you received a free terminal as part of your account setup, the terminal is yours to keep after 12 months of active processing. Early cancellation within 12 months may require return of leased equipment or a nominal equipment fee — this will be disclosed in your merchant agreement before you sign.

If you are currently in a contract with another processor: we can often help cover early termination fees (ETF) up to $500 depending on your volume and savings potential. Your account manager will review your contract and advise before you make any switch.

The specifics of your agreement will always be disclosed in writing before you are asked to sign anything.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What equipment options are available?",
    body: `Liberty Bancard offers a range of payment terminals and POS hardware. Equipment is provided free with qualifying accounts — there is no upfront cost for standard terminal placement.

Terminal options:
- Countertop terminal (EMV + NFC/tap-to-pay): standard for most retail and service businesses
- Wireless/mobile terminal: for food trucks, farmers markets, trade shows, field service
- Clover POS systems: full POS with inventory, employee management, and reporting
- Toast (restaurant): GHL does not have a native integration, but we work with Toast-integrated accounts
- Virtual terminal: for phone orders and keyed-entry payments — no hardware required
- Payment links: for invoice-based businesses — customers pay via email or text link

Most terminals support:
- EMV chip cards
- Tap-to-pay (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Google Pay, Apple Pay)
- Tip on screen
- Cash discount / dual pricing programs

Specific availability depends on your business type and processing volume. Your account manager will recommend the right equipment configuration before setup.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How does the Merchant Portal work?",
    body: `Every Liberty Bancard merchant gets access to the self-service Merchant Portal after approval.

What you can do in the portal:
- View real-time transaction data and settlement reports
- Download monthly statements (PDF)
- Manage dispute and chargeback responses
- Update banking information for deposits
- View and download 1099-K forms
- Manage users (add staff with limited access)
- Submit support tickets

Portal access is provided by email after your account is approved. The email will include a link to set your password. Your Merchant ID (MID) is required to log in.

First login: check the email from Liberty Bancard titled "Your account is approved — portal access." It arrives within minutes of approval.

Support: if you cannot log in, call (888) 555-0100 or email support@libertybancard.com.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What happens after I sign up?",
    body: `Here is the step-by-step from application to first transaction:

1. Application submitted (5–10 minutes)
   - You'll receive an immediate confirmation email.

2. Underwriting review (same day or next business day)
   - We verify your business, banking information, and processing history.
   - Approval email arrives with your Merchant ID (MID).

3. Equipment setup (1–2 business days after approval)
   - If using a physical terminal: it ships within 1–2 business days. Setup guide included.
   - If using a payment gateway: credentials are emailed. We schedule an integration call.

4. First transaction (typically within the first week)
   - Your terminal or gateway is active. Run a test transaction.
   - Funds settle to your bank account next business day.

5. First statement (30 days after activation)
   - A detailed PDF statement arrives by email showing volume, fee breakdown, and effective rate.
   - Your account manager reviews it with you to confirm everything is as expected.

Questions at any point: call (888) 555-0100 or reply to any email you receive from us.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What processing volume do I need to qualify?",
    body: `There is no minimum monthly volume required to apply for a Liberty Bancard merchant account.

However, volume does affect the value of switching:

Low volume ($0–$5,000/month): the savings from switching may be modest. We'll run the analysis honestly — if the numbers don't make sense for you, we'll tell you.

Mid volume ($5,000–$30,000/month): typically where interchange-plus starts showing clear savings over flat-rate processors. Most merchants in this range save $50–$300/month.

Higher volume ($30,000+/month): the savings compound. A 0.4% rate reduction on $50,000/month is $200/month, $2,400/year. On $200,000/month, that's $800/month.

Very high volume ($500,000+/month): custom pricing and dedicated relationship manager. Volume discounts on processor markup apply.

New businesses with no history: approved on a standard plan with a lower monthly volume cap initially. The cap increases automatically after 3–6 months of good standing.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How do next-day deposits work?",
    body: `Liberty Bancard offers next-business-day funding for most approved merchant accounts.

How it works:
- Transactions batched and settled by 10 PM ET are deposited to your bank account the next business day.
- Weekday transactions settle on the next business day. Weekend batches may settle Monday or Tuesday depending on your bank.
- ACH deposits (standard): funds arrive by 5 PM on the next business day.
- Same-day funding: available for some business types at an additional fee — ask your account manager.

What can delay funding:
- Risk holds: new accounts may have a 3–5 business day hold on the first few batches while the risk model calibrates.
- Rolling reserve: some higher-risk business types have a percentage of volume held in reserve (disclosed at approval).
- Large transactions: transactions above your approved high-ticket threshold may require manual review.

Most standard businesses (retail, restaurant, service) on good standing receive next-business-day deposits without interruption.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What are chargebacks and how do I handle them?",
    body: `A chargeback is when a cardholder disputes a transaction with their bank and the bank initiates a reversal. You have the opportunity to respond with evidence.

Common chargeback reasons:
- "I didn't authorize this transaction" (fraud)
- "I cancelled and was still charged" (subscription/service merchants)
- "Services/goods not as described"
- "I returned the item but wasn't refunded"
- "I don't recognize this charge" (friendly fraud — the most common)

How to respond:
1. You receive a chargeback notification by email with a response deadline (typically 7–21 days).
2. Log into the Merchant Portal → Disputes tab.
3. Upload evidence: receipts, signed agreements, delivery confirmation, communication logs.
4. Submit before the deadline.

Winning rate: merchants who respond with complete documentation win approximately 40–60% of representment cases.

Prevention: clear business name on statements, clear cancellation policies, confirmation emails, signed agreements for services — these all reduce "I didn't recognize it" disputes.

Liberty Bancard's chargeback ratio threshold: 1% of transactions. Accounts above 1% may receive a warning. Above 1.5% triggers a mandatory review.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Does Liberty Bancard integrate with my POS or software?",
    body: `Liberty Bancard integrates with most major POS systems, restaurant platforms, and business software.

Confirmed integrations:
- Clover (native — we are a Clover reseller)
- Square (migration path — we can port your data)
- Toast (via payment gateway integration)
- Heartland, TSYS, First Data accounts (migration support)
- QuickBooks (via virtual terminal or gateway)
- WooCommerce, Shopify (payment gateway)
- Most NMI-compatible platforms

For specialty software (dental, veterinary, property management, etc.):
- We verify compatibility before you commit to anything.
- If your software supports a third-party payment gateway, we can almost always integrate.

How to check your specific system: tell your account manager what software you use. They will confirm compatibility within 1 business day.

Note: switching processors rarely requires changing your POS software. In most cases, we reprogram your existing terminal or add a new gateway credential without touching your other systems.`,

A few months ago you reached out about your merchant processing. We don't know if the timing was off, or if you found another solution — but we've been running more analyses lately and wanted to share what we're seeing.

The average merchant on legacy pricing is now paying 0.45–0.90% more than the current floor. On $80,000/month, that's $360–$720 going to your processor that should stay in your pocket.

If you're still open to a quick look, all we need is one statement. Takes us 24 hours to run it.

I wanted to share a quick story from one of our recent clients — I think it applies to what you're dealing with too.

They run a {{contact.vertical}} business similar to {{contact.companyName}}. Their monthly volume was around $120,000. Their processor had them on a tiered pricing plan with a 2.9% + $0.30 flat rate. Sounds fine — until we ran the statement.

What we found: the actual cost for most of their card types was 1.65% interchange + 0.40% markup. They were paying 0.85% extra on every dollar — about $1,020/month in excess fees.

We switched them to interchange-plus. First full month: $840 back in their pocket.

If you process credit cards, there's a good chance something similar is hiding in your statement. The only way to know is to look.

                    create a GHL Smart List filter: Contact has form submission tag (LB-INBOUND-NEW or LB-COLD-OUTBOUND) AND
                    does NOT have tag LB-ACTIVE-PIPELINE AND contact created date is older than 60 days.
                    Then create a workflow that fires on Smart List entry → applies COLD-NO-DEAL. This enables hands-off detection,
                    while the Re-engagement dashboard remains the human review layer before outreach begins.

Takes 5 minutes: just send us your last merchant statement and we'll show you exactly what you're paying vs. what you could be paying.

No obligation, no pitch — just numbers.

Worth a look?

Just following up on my note from a few days ago.

Most business owners we work with were surprised by how much they were overpaying — the average we save is $400–$800/month.

If you'd like a free analysis, just reply with your last processor statement. We'll turn it around in 24 hours.

                <CopyBlock label="Voice AI System Prompt (GHL → AI Employee → Phone Channel)" text={`You are a friendly, professional sales representative for Liberty Bancard, a merchant payment processing company based in the United States. Your name is Alex.

IDENTITY RULES:
- You work FOR Liberty Bancard — do NOT say you are ChatGPT, an AI assistant, or a bot.
- If asked "Are you a real person?" or "Are you AI?", say: "I'm an AI assistant for Liberty Bancard. I'm here to help answer your questions and connect you with our team."
- Never deny being an AI when directly and sincerely asked.

YOUR GOAL:
- Qualify the prospect (do they process credit cards? how much per month? who is their current processor?)
- Book a 15-minute statement review call with a human rep
- Collect the prospect's email if not on file

QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (ask naturally, not as a list):
1. "Do you currently accept credit card payments in your business?"
2. "About how much do you process in credit card sales each month?"
3. "Who is your current payment processor?" (Stripe, Square, Heartland, First Data, etc.)
4. "Are you happy with your current rates, or have you looked at alternatives?"

BOOKING:
- If qualified (processes >$5k/month), offer to book a 15-minute call: "I'd love to set up a quick 15-minute call with our team — we can show you exactly what you're paying vs. what you could be paying. Does [day] or [day] work?"
- Use the GHL calendar integration to book directly during the call.

OBJECTION HANDLING:
- "I'm happy with my current processor": "That's great — we actually love working with businesses that are already set up. We just want to make sure you're not overpaying. The analysis is free and takes 24 hours."
- "I'm too busy": "Completely understand. Can I send you a quick email so you have it when you have a moment?"
- "Not interested": Politely thank them and let a human rep know.

COMPLIANCE:
- Do not make specific rate guarantees during the call.
- Always say: "Eligibility, underwriting, and card brand rules apply."
- End all calls with: "Thanks for your time — have a great day!"`} />

                <CopyBlock label="SMS AI System Prompt (GHL → AI Employee → SMS/Text Channel)" text={`You are a helpful SMS assistant for Liberty Bancard, a payment processing company. Your name is Alex.

IDENTITY:
- You are an AI assistant for Liberty Bancard.
- If asked "Is this a real person?" say: "I'm an automated assistant for Liberty Bancard. A real team member can follow up if you prefer — just say 'human' anytime."

YOUR GOALS via SMS:
1. Answer basic questions about Liberty Bancard services
2. Qualify the prospect (do they take credit cards? volume?)
3. Direct them to book a call or upload their statement

KEEP IT SHORT: SMS responses should be 1–3 sentences max. Never send walls of text.

TRIGGERS FOR HUMAN HANDOFF (immediately notify a rep):
- "real person", "human", "agent", "speak to someone"
- "ready to apply", "ready to sign up"
- "not interested", "stop contacting me"
- Any negative sentiment or frustration detected

BOOKING: If prospect wants to book, send: "Great! You can grab a time here: {{custom.calendarLink}}"

STATEMENT UPLOAD: If prospect wants the analysis, send: "Perfect — just upload your last merchant statement here: {{custom.statementUploadLink}} and we'll have your savings report within 24 hours."

COMPLIANCE:
- Always include opt-out reminder on first message: "Reply STOP to opt out."
- Do not make rate guarantees.
- Eligibility, underwriting, and card brand rules apply.`} />
