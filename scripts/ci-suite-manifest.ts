/**
 * ci-suite-manifest.ts — Capability-classified CI suite manifest
 *
 * Classifies every suite registered in pre-deploy.ts MANDATORY_SUITES into
 * one of four capability tiers. CI jobs must only run suites appropriate for
 * their tier — required suites cannot be omitted, skipped, or substituted
 * without a documented capability gate change here.
 *
 * Capability tiers:
 *   deterministic-static      — pure-function / AST scan; no server, no DB,
 *                               no network. Always deterministic. Runs in the
 *                               CI `static` job.
 *   deterministic-integration — requires disposable PostgreSQL and/or Redis;
 *                               no live provider calls. GHL is blocked via
 *                               GHL_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST=true. Runs in the CI
 *                               `integration` job.
 *   server-required           — needs a running dev server at localhost:5000
 *                               AND a live database. Hard-fails if server is
 *                               not reachable. Runs in CI `integration` job
 *                               after server startup.
 *   server-optional           — needs a running server but is skipped (not
 *                               failed) when the server is absent. These suites
 *                               test live-mode provider integrations (OpenAI,
 *                               GHL, etc.) that require real credentials. NOT
 *                               run in automated CI; must be run by an operator
 *                               with live credentials before each production deploy.
 *
 * Provider denial controls (deterministic suites only):
 *   GHL         — GHL_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST=true installs the server-level fail-fast
 *                 transport; any real GHL call throws TestTransportError.
 *                 Verified by test-forms.ts via /api/health.
 *   Serper      — Covered by SERPER_GATEWAY_ENABLED flag and scan-serper-raw-fetch.ts.
 *   OpenAI      — Not called in deterministic suites (AI boundaries are server-optional).
 *   SMTP        — Not called by suites (SMTP sends go through gated compliance paths
 *                 which are themselves gated by outboundGlobalPaused=true).
 *   Sunbiz      — Blocked by SUNBIZ_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=false default in test env.
 *
 * Runner guarantees:
 *   - pre-deploy.ts verifies outboundGlobalPaused=true before and after every suite.
 *   - All suites are run as child processes (spawnSync) — no shared in-process state.
 *   - Required suites exit nonzero to fail the parent gate; cannot be silently skipped.
 *
 * Usage (self-validation):
 *   npx tsx scripts/ci-suite-manifest.ts [--check]
 *   --check: exits nonzero if the manifest is inconsistent.
