# Liberty Bancard — Stage 3 consolidated findings and implementation specification

> **Current decision — 2026-10-03:** Task #2061 remains aligned with Task A; apply five bounded amendments and build. Serving c893360a and main 7fd447ad have identical tracked trees; portable lock policy still fails. See Section 15 and the separate Task 2061 review. Older source/runtime snapshots below are historical; no repairs/deployment/full Stage 3 certification claimed by this review.

**Updated after current live/source verification 2026-10-02. Stage 3 OPEN / NOT CERTIFIED. Section 13 is the authoritative current disposition: 22 confirmed distinct repair causes; Provider Results navigation verified repaired; no audit-authored source repairs, merge or deployment.**

This is the working specification combining the Stage 3 CRM audit, *Dashboard Audit: Findings, Bugs & Fix List* and *What’s Broken (Oct 2026)*. Every source entry has one primary repair group, a preserved reference and a closure requirement. The 26 Stage 3 entries and 69 reference claim rows overlap: **95 traceable source entries, 14 repair groups, eight proposed execution tasks (A, B, C1–C5 and D). Neither 95 nor 14 is a count of unique verified defects.** A source claim can include several allegations with different evidence strengths; its qualification stays attached.

Outbound email, SMS and sequences stay paused. The original baseline observed GHL sync killed; the later GHL repair and current one-way incoming requirements are reconciled in Section 12. That historical registry state is not current incoming-runtime evidence. This reconciliation does not activate workers, clear queues, trigger external workflows, send a message, purchase enrichment, change access or remove production data. The safe capability separation is a required repair, not a blanket unpause.

Use Section 13 for all current verification dispositions; Section 12 retains the preceding GHL follow-up; use Sections 2–4 as the retained findings/repair contract, 5–6 for navigation and tab reconciliation, 7 for metric definitions, 8–9 for design and workflow, and 10–11 for execution and acceptance. Appendices retain every route, observed panel entry and reference-audit disposition. Historical evidence remains available; new evidence does not overwrite it.

## 1. Historical evidence baseline and limits — superseded where Section 13 differs

Evidence | Reviewed value / implication
--- | ---
GitHub main / local reviewed source | `51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973`; tree `4e487f84ca16b002e306a9a190baf4778accf0c4`. Clean detached checkout.
Serving /api/health | `26a7da8bf96d80eb7a125bb6521e6140e3b5c8d5`; built `2026-10-02T10:36:34.721Z`; production; publishBuildId `ba1896d0-facc-417c-acb1-74c7ab780f89`; ghlTransportFailFast=false. Status ok is not all-system certification.
Provenance gap | GitHub fetch of serving commit returned No Commit Found (422). Source/live equivalence remains unproved. PublishBuildId is a new improvement, so “no build identifier” is superseded.
Source diff since original Stage 3 | 19 files, 566 additions / 7 deletions; mainly SFP runtime/build identity/docs. CRM routes/pages/CSS, contacts/campaigns and package-lock were unchanged. Current source anchors retain their audited causes; the serving-source archive is still required.
Fresh live checks | Signed-in Scott admin, desktop; C-001–C-026 snapshots captured October 2. Some intermediate captures are loading states; only settled observations are conclusions. No new persisted production mutations were submitted.
Original coverage | 145/146 route patterns reached, including all 142 static routes; 309 observed panel entries; 8,704 contextual control observations. These are inventory observations, not unique buttons or functional passes.
Still unproved | Manager/agent/merchant/partner real-session behavior; anonymous/IDOR mutation tests; narrow viewport and touch; durable create/edit/archive/restore; degraded integration responses; native GHL; workers and no-send canaries.
Tests | This consolidation validated mapping completeness, source anchors and current live observations. Original test/build/CI logs remain historical; no full current CI/security/database/role suite was re-certified.
Reference files | Dashboard DOCX SHA256 b9544f1c2dfe5e96539b110ccfb361ce5fee17a0b2024ddc74671e26a37603e4; What’s Broken DOCX SHA256 cf7c781aaf86cb6a421d9ae011e5bcc0af4d9b964e38ff6855aee0a0ea674431. Findings and narrative families retained in Appendix C.

### Fresh evidence that changes or strengthens the old report

- Home: Pending Tasks **3,075**, overdue **3,072**; briefing overdue **3,082**, but AI says no immediate tasks/overdue alerts. The settled Tasks view shows **three pending tasks**, all unassigned and due October 6. There is a current list/count/advice inconsistency; its full database reconciliation is a repair acceptance requirement.
- Contacts: current KPI/All count **154,407**; Production **154,005** and Test **402**. Header cards use the broader denominator while the production list uses a narrower one. Home’s production contact total is **154,005**. Different populations must be labelled, not forced equal.
- Pipeline is now **two deals**, both unassigned, with Liberty QATest display names. Contact #159443 has an internal no-email placeholder, three linked deals and three tasks, yet Pipeline exposes two. The record name suggests a fixture; its intended record-class assignment and archive scopes require receipts before cleanup. The previous “pipeline has zero” is historical, not current.
- That contact receives **25/25 email readiness points** for an internal placeholder. Its authoritative next-action card correctly blocks global pause. Readiness and communication permission are distinct concepts and should be presented together.
- GHL says **All Systems Healthy** and last sync August 22 while lower rows show September entity runs with **159 task / 6,929 deal / 1,174 company / 68,549 contact errors**. These are displayed counters, not proved current unique failed records. Contact sync shows 1,915 synced of 154,407 and 152,492 unsynced; another panel counts 154,411 total. Scope/as-of definitions are missing. Do not sum historical sync events as unique records.
- GHL Sync is **killed**; registry has 19 automations, 12 killed. Enrichment shows an active recent run with zero records; that is not consumption or provider success proof. Stage mapping reports **2/19 local resolved** and **four external stages discovered**; Closed Won and Closed Lost display the same shortened external identifier. Full IDs and semantics need independent verification before changing mappings.
- Queue Holds crashes with `(t.desiredLogicalHolds ?? []).map is not a function`; Permissions shows **0 of 0** API routes. Provider Results sets its URL but selects Businesses. Financial aliases select Revenue. Worker Heartbeats navigation drops the monitor parent and selects System Readiness.

These are new observations attached to existing repair groups, not automatically extra unique findings. In particular, the 402-record difference explains a scope mismatch; it does not prove all those test records are leaking into each production workflow.

### R01 — Serving source and reproducible delivery

**Scope:** Release evidence / dependency installation. **Task:** A.

Obtain the source archive or accessible commit that produced the serving build, including lockfile and build receipts. Repair private resolved lockfile URLs using a reproducible supported registry dependency set; regenerate the lockfile without changing package intent. Re-run clean stock CI. Do not install a private-URL workaround as a certified release or claim source fixes are deployed from a publish label.

**Code destinations:** [package-lock.json](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/package-lock.json); [script/build.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/script/build.ts); [shared/sfp-publish-build-identity.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/shared/sfp-publish-build-identity.ts)

### R02 — Authorization, identity and user operations

**Scope:** Security-critical ownership / staff onboarding. **Task:** A/B.

Reuse CRM object authorization in collection SQL and per-ID bulk mutations. Filter before read/aggregation, authorize every selected ID, and reject inaccessible IDs before any local tag or enrollment write. Put the existing provisioning and resend-invite capability inside User Management, with eligible role/owner checks and audited recoverable deactivate/reactivate workflow. Never grant new access as part of a diagnostic audit.

**Code destinations:** [server/routes/contacts.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/contacts.ts); [server/services/crm-object-access.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/crm-object-access.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ActivationPanel.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ActivationPanel.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/UserManagement.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/UserManagement.tsx)

### R03 — GHL sync, integration truth and runtime ownership

**Scope:** Data sync must work independently of paused communications. **Task:** A.

Separate capability policies for CRM data synchronization, permission/opt-out propagation, provider spend, and communications/enrollment. Retain fail-closed outbound enforcement and epoch/inflight controls. Permit only explicitly reviewed non-communicating GHL writes; field/tag/stage changes can fire external workflows, so use an allowlist and verify native trigger safety. Give GHL Sync a separate control and explicit owner/worker profile. Replace Healthy with individual configured, connected, enabled, last-success, fresh heartbeat, backlog and error states. Retain distinct historical counters and current entity counts; repair mapping with explicit semantic IDs, never title matching alone.

**Code destinations:** [server/routes/ghl-mutation-pause.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/ghl-mutation-pause.ts); [server/services/ghl.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/ghl.ts); [server/services/ghl-sync.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/ghl-sync.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/GhlSettings.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/GhlSettings.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/AutomationRegistry.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/AutomationRegistry.tsx); [server/services/cro03/sfp-runtime-fence.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/cro03/sfp-runtime-fence.ts)

### R04 — Tasks, assignment, SLA and notification work queues

**Scope:** Make the rep worklist match the counts and advice. **Task:** B.

Create one scoped task predicate and status normalization used by list, KPI, overdue badge and briefing. Exclude soft-deleted tasks and nonproduction linked entities by default, apply actor/team ownership, and use one as-of timestamp/timezone. Pass overdue task facts into AI summaries and suppress reassuring text when data is degraded. Separate historical breached tickets from actionable work. Configure eligible owner routing with an explicit unassigned fallback queue, retry/dedupe keys and receipts. Fix notification links to correct entity context and handle missing/archived targets.

**Code destinations:** [server/storage/tasks.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/storage/tasks.ts); [server/routes/tickets-tasks.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/tickets-tasks.ts); [server/routes/analytics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/analytics.ts); [server/routes/daily-briefing.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/daily-briefing.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/Tasks.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Tasks.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/RoundRobinAdmin.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/RoundRobinAdmin.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/Notifications.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Notifications.tsx)

### R05 — Route, tab and diagnostic response contracts

**Scope:** Verified wrong destination / crash / misleading diagnostic. **Task:** C.

Use one typed destination registry shared by menu, aliases, tab validation and contextual links. Repair the five specific contracts listed below. Preserve role guards and compatible query/object context; unknown selections must show an explanation rather than a successful wrong panel. Diagnostics must distinguish unsupported/unavailable from successful empty. Render query errors and non-array response mismatches without a page crash.

**Code destinations:** [client/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/App.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/SystemHealthHub.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/SystemHealthHub.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/FinancialHub.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/FinancialHub.tsx); [client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx); [server/services/outbound-queue-coordinator.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/outbound-queue-coordinator.ts); [server/routes/permissions-audit.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/permissions-audit.ts)

### R06 — Record scope, metric definitions and honest financial models

**Scope:** Shared data predicates / valid denominators. **Task:** A.

Extend the existing revenue read authority across counts, lists, facets and exports. Apply the same record class, archive/delete, owner, lifecycle and date scope to the same named metric. Show scope and as-of time. Keep event metrics separate from object counts; label local vs external and observed vs estimated. Classify protected fixtures through audited explicit metadata, never mass cleanup by name/email heuristic. Split terminal forecasts from actual deployments and residual-ledger results. Replace cold-lead unsupported value totals with a clearly labelled scenario or remove the dollars; move paging/counting to scoped SQL.

**Code destinations:** [server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts); [server/routes/contacts.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/contacts.ts); [server/routes/analytics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/analytics.ts); [server/routes/terminal-economics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/terminal-economics.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/TerminalROI.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/TerminalROI.tsx)

### R07 — Sequences, campaigns and enrollment lifecycle

**Scope:** Join amplification / ownership contract / safe maintenance. **Task:** A/B.

Aggregate sequence steps and enrollments independently before joining by sequence ID. Calculate stalled/active/paused/terminal states from distinct enrollment identities and their real states. Fetch manager enrollments by authorized sequence ID or expose a scoped aggregate contract; show 403/errors explicitly. Document local cadence vs GHL-managed workflow semantics so local-only rows do not falsely require an external ID. Add preview/recoverable archive/cancel where justified; cancel queued work safely and audit idempotently. Sending/enrollment remains paused.

**Code destinations:** [server/routes/campaigns.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/campaigns.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/SequenceReport.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/SequenceReport.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/OutboundCenter.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/OutboundCenter.tsx)

### R08 — Record workspace, navigation and lifecycle productivity

**Scope:** Proposed usability work and relationship completeness. **Task:** B/C.

Implement the route and tab reconciliation tables below, shared page templates and the five-area record workspace. Keep original IDs and verified association state distinct from suggestions. Make company/business/contact/deal/application/contract/MID relationships navigable with provenance and explicit missing/conflicted states. Bring contextual call, note, task, ticket, next-step and document actions next to the record. Explain filtered-empty vs genuinely empty vs inaccessible vs failed. Verify editing, cancellation and refresh against durable outcomes.

### R09 — Consent, privacy requests and retained audit evidence

**Scope:** Reference allegations pending receipts / avoid harmful cleanup. **Task:** B.

Reconcile consent source, purpose, channel, capture time and test classification without deleting historical evidence. Exercise request intake, verification, scope, retention/legal exceptions, completion and audit on protected fixtures. Preserve localhost/curl audit entries as classified evidence. Channel permissions must agree with the communication authority and safely propagate to GHL even while sends are paused.

### R10 — Recoverable record lifecycle and cleanup verification

**Scope:** Unproved historical delete/archive allegations and requested upgrades. **Task:** B.

First reproduce each action on a tagged disposable fixture and inventory dependencies. Prefer reversible archive/deactivate/resolve and explain its effect. Require per-ID authorization, previewed dependent impacts, transactional/idempotent writes, correct row event propagation, restored records, cache invalidation and audit receipts. Preserve the claim of past deletes/archives as history until before/after IDs and receipts exist. Do not execute deletion of production artifacts or audit logs during reconciliation.

### R11 — Readiness probes, security and operating knowledge

**Scope:** Diagnostics and later-lane obligations. **Task:** C/D.

Replace schema-invalid readiness SQL with schema-owned queries and tested unavailable states. Correct diagnosis without turning configuration badges into health proof. Retain observed admin 2FA gap, PCI self-assessment state and training/knowledge gaps as explicit ownership items. Publish role-specific workflow documentation matching the redesigned CRM. Stage 8 closes training/AI claims and Stage 9 certifies security/release; Stage 3 tests their CRM UI and API surfaces without asserting PCI certification.

**Code destinations:** [server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/KnowledgeBase.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/KnowledgeBase.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/Training.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Training.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/SecuritySettings.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/SecuritySettings.tsx)

### R12 — Inbox, contactability and communication explanations

**Scope:** Intentional pause and real workflow gaps. **Task:** B.

Keep global composer and move its existing capability into record context with prefilled recipient and permissions. Distinguish syntactic email presence, validated deliverability, intent, channel consent and actual send eligibility. Internal no-email placeholders must not earn deliverability/readiness credit. Inbox unread/channel filters, detail, assignment, reply and activity must have a shared role scope and durable state. Disabled send actions explain the exact reason while drafts and non-send record work remain usable.

**Code destinations:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/CommsHub.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/CommsHub.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx); [server/services/contact-readiness.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/contact-readiness.ts); [server/services/outbound-pause-authority.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/outbound-pause-authority.ts)

### R13 — Bounded loading and runtime UI performance

**Scope:** Performance upgrade grounded in large panels / old build evidence. **Task:** C.

Lazy-mount secondary sections, split heavy route modules, use bounded server pagination/keyset loading and limit concurrent requests. Preserve selected URL/filter/scroll across detail and back navigation. Use skeletons for first load, stale-labelled cached data during refresh and retry/error states. Measure representative large datasets and browser timings after the change; historical bundle warnings alone are not Web Vitals evidence.

**Code destinations:** [client/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/App.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx)

### R14 — Native GHL and later-lane verification obligations

**Scope:** Provider-native / external / higher-stage assertions. **Task:** D.

Verify native GHL account, stage IDs, workflows, login/roles, branding, integrations and historical opportunity/restore claims with the right signed-in account and receipts. Do not force equal stage/form/user counts between systems with different purposes. Record explicit dispositions and lane owners. Prospecting/provider execution belongs to Stage 4; application/processor execution to Stage 5; revenue/payments to Stage 6; ads/analytics/A2P-dependent conversion work to Stage 7 or its communications owner; training and final release to Stages 8–9.

**Code destinations:** Provider-native evidence and later-stage ledger entries; no local source fix inferred.

## 3. Exact Stage 3 finding dispositions and code repair destinations

Each item below separates current observation from proposed repair. **Source confirmed** means the reviewed code contains the identified cause; it does not certify that a repair was deployed or that an untested role can exploit it. **Upgrade** identifies a desired product change, not a denied defect. The older detailed acceptance remains attached to the evidence register, and the scoped acceptance below controls implementation.

### CRM3-01 — Production cannot be bound to the reviewed source

**Current verification (Section 13):** SUPERSEDED FOR CURRENT BUILD — serving source is accessible and content-equivalent to reviewed HEAD; release/CI receipts remain separate.

**Primary repair:** R01. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-001 / health. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Current build includes publishBuildId, but serving commit is unavailable through GitHub and differs from reviewed main.

**Exact repair:** Acquire exact serving source and build receipt; compare relevant changes before applying fixes. Source SHA/build ID are evidence, not a Stage 9 freeze.

**Code:** [script/build.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/script/build.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R01, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-02 — Stock CI cannot install its lockfile

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT — fresh stock install fails private registry URL (V01).

**Primary repair:** R01. **Evidence state:** SOURCE; old CI failure, clean current CI not rerun. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Private lockfile URLs persist because package-lock.json is unchanged from the audited baseline.

**Exact repair:** Regenerate a portable lockfile using intended public/authorized package versions; prove clean npm ci and existing required CI.

**Code:** [package-lock.json](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/package-lock.json). Shared scope and acceptance: R01, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-03 — GHL sync is killed and data writes share the send pause

**Current verification (Section 13):** SEPARATION OBSERVED LIVE; IMPORT FAILURE OPEN (V16). Old killed incoming claim is superseded.

**Primary repair:** R03. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-011/C-012. **Implementation state:** SOURCE REPAIR IMPLEMENTED (partial for composite finding); runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**2026-10-02 follow-up:** Source separation and one-way GHL → database preview/apply are implemented, and health reports the repair commit. Earlier killed/undifferentiated-gating observations below are historical. Runtime import/webhook closure remains unverified; use Section 12, not a second separation build.

**Reconciliation:** GHL Sync remains killed. Contact upsert still calls outbound pause authority with an undifferentiated capability.

**Exact repair:** Introduce reviewed data-sync capabilities and retain denied send/enrollment paths. Verify external trigger safety before enabling only the sync worker.

**Code:** [server/services/ghl.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/ghl.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R03, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-04 — Connected/configured badges falsely imply operational health

**Current verification (Section 13):** TOP-LEVEL HEALTH LABEL REPAIRED; full data/worker completion still unproved. Sequence runtime copy remains defective (V18).

**Primary repair:** R03. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-010/C-012. **Implementation state:** SOURCE REPAIR IMPLEMENTED (partial for composite finding); runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**2026-10-02 follow-up:** Partial source repair implemented: truthful health-probe wording, runtime/control evidence and incoming preview/actual states. Original observations below are historical; current live work and metric scope still require verification. See Section 12.

**Reconciliation:** Healthy/Connected message contradicts entity error rows, old sync and killed sync worker.

**Exact repair:** Derive separate connection/data/worker/send states; aggregate healthy only when required observations are fresh and successful.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/GhlSettings.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/GhlSettings.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R03, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-05 — Work counts and AI briefing contradict actionable tasks

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT (V02/V03).

**Primary repair:** R04. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-001/C-003. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Home pending/overdue and briefing differ from the three visible current pending tasks. AI claims no overdue alerts.

**Exact repair:** Share task scope/status/soft-delete rules and as-of time; include overdueTaskCount and degraded flags in briefing prompt and rendered text.

**Code:** [server/routes/daily-briefing.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/daily-briefing.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R04, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-06 — Permissions audit silently returns zero routes

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT (V04).

**Primary repair:** R05. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-005. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Permissions reports Showing 0 of 0 registered API routes in Express 5 app.

**Exact repair:** Use Express 5 supported router structure or explicit registration manifest; include mounted middleware/roles; do not infer public from missing metadata. Fail unavailable on empty extraction.

**Code:** [server/routes/permissions-audit.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/permissions-audit.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R05, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-07 — Queue Holds crashes on its response contract

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT (V05).

**Primary repair:** R05. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-008. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Queue Holds reproduces desiredLogicalHolds.map is not a function.

**Exact repair:** Define one shared DTO and convert coordinator Record entries into a typed array before rendering, or render the Record deliberately; runtime validate and show failure instead of crashing.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R05, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-08 — Provider Results tab routes back to Businesses

**Current verification (Section 13):** VERIFIED REPAIRED for click/deep-link/reload navigation; provider execution remains separate.

**Primary repair:** R05. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-014. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Clicking Provider Results puts provider-results in URL but selects Businesses.

**Exact repair:** Add provider-results to the typed valid-tab registry and bind its intended existing panel; check selected tab and distinct panel contents on deep link/back/refresh.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOpsCenter.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R05, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-09 — Operator navigation exits its parent hub

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT (V06).

**Primary repair:** R05. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-025/C-026. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Worker Heartbeats click drops tab=monitor and selects System Readiness.

**Exact repair:** Keep tab=monitor when changing view, preserving owned filter parameters; use a shared query builder across parent and child.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R05, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-10 — Financial aliases select the wrong report

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT for Forecasting alias (V07); nested Terminal ROI selection works.

**Primary repair:** R05. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-015/C-016/C-017. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Forecasting and Terminal ROI aliases both select Revenue Dashboard.

**Exact repair:** Redirect to reporting?tab=financial&financialTab=forecasting or terminal-roi; normalize standalone financial-hub legacy tab keys.

**Code:** [client/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/App.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R05, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-11 — Scope mismatches make lists and reports disagree

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT unlabeled record-scope mismatch (V08); expected 402 test-record difference is not itself a data defect.

**Primary repair:** R06. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-010/C-023. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Contact KPI totals count all 154407 classes while Production list shows 154005; difference 402 Test. GHL totals use further scopes.

**Exact repair:** Use readPeople/readPeopleFacets predicates for same-scope KPIs and export. Default production operational KPIs; label all-class census and sync ledger separately.

**Code:** [server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R06, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-12 — Terminal ROI represents test/new-lead equipment as deployed

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT source and live semantics (V09).

**Primary repair:** R06. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; original live observed; current real-deployment proof pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Terminal report labels every terminal recommendation deployed and projects paid-off from estimated GP/time.

**Exact repair:** Return separate proposed/ordered/deployed states with source/activation evidence and exclude archived/nonproduction objects. Actual payback uses ledger cash flows; forecast uses explicit assumptions.

**Code:** [server/routes/terminal-economics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/terminal-economics.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R06, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-13 — Readiness and contactability advice disagree with actual permission

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED CURRENT completeness scoring defect (V10); NBA blocks pause correctly.

**Primary repair:** R12. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-021. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Current internal no-email placeholder gets 25/25 email readiness points; NBA correctly blocks global pause.

**Exact repair:** Reject known internal placeholder domain in readiness, keep data completeness separate from validated contactability, and display authoritative permission reasons on every advice/action card.

**Code:** [server/services/contact-readiness.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/contact-readiness.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R12, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-14 — Cold-lead collection and bulk re-engagement lack agent scope

**Current verification (Section 13):** SOURCE-CONFIRMED actor-scope omission (V11); live other-role exploit untested.

**Primary repair:** R02. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; role-session exploit not attempted. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Cold-lead collection and selected-ID bulk mutation omit agent scope; path guard is not a collection guard.

**Exact repair:** Apply actor scope in SQL and per selected ID before local changes; test agent/manager/admin read/export/bulk unauthorized IDs.

**Code:** [server/routes/contacts.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/contacts.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R02, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-15 — Re-engagement audience label and value math are unsupported

**Current verification (Section 13):** SOURCE-CONFIRMED unsupported model (V12).

**Primary repair:** R06. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; original live observed. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Cold-lead label and total*15000 value do not establish form intent, conversion probability or revenue.

**Exact repair:** Separate dormant imported contacts from abandoned inbound requests, calculate bounded scoped count in SQL and remove unsupported revenue claim or show explicit editable forecast assumptions.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R06, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-16 — Sequence report counts are multiplied by a join

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED with actual SQL disposable fixture (V13).

**Primary repair:** R07. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; current dataset recount pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Report joins many steps and enrollments before summing states, multiplying counts.

**Exact repair:** Use independent enrollment and step aggregate CTEs or grouped subqueries; enforce distinct identities with a multi-step fixture and compare list/report totals.

**Code:** [server/routes/campaigns.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/routes/campaigns.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R07, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-17 — Manager enrollment fetch contract produces misleading empty counts

**Current verification (Section 13):** SOURCE-CONFIRMED client/API contract defect (V14); live manager session untested.

**Primary repair:** R07. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; manager browser proof pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Manager global enrollments request conflicts with API requirement for an owned sequence ID.

**Exact repair:** Choose scoped per-sequence queries or a manager-scoped summary; render forbidden/unavailable rather than zero. Preserve ownership enforcement.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R07, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-18 — Assignment and SLA handoff do not create an actionable rep queue

**Current verification (Section 13):** UNASSIGNED CONFIGURATION OBSERVED; assignment/SLA engine causal failure not yet proved.

**Primary repair:** R04. **Evidence state:** LIVE C-003/C-019 + SOURCE; causal canary pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Current task rows and both pipeline records are unassigned; assignment/SLA worker configuration does not prove an actionable queue.

**Exact repair:** Define eligible owner routing and unassigned queue; audit assignment, due date and dedupe receipts through protected inbound and rep workflow fixtures.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/RoundRobinAdmin.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/RoundRobinAdmin.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R04, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-19 — Launch probes contain schema-invalid queries

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED invalid columns on disposable current-schema fixture (V15); full probe suite pending.

**Primary repair:** R11. **Evidence state:** SOURCE confirmed; full current probe suite pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Readiness SQL references users.deleted_at and document_type absent from schema.

**Exact repair:** Trace schema-owned columns and repair each probe with failure/degraded state; use migrations/schema assertions in existing readiness tests.

**Code:** [server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R11, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-20 — Enrichment runtime owner and worker health are not proved

**Current verification (Section 13):** RUNTIME OWNERSHIP/CONSUMPTION STILL UNPROVED; no provider canary activated.

**Primary repair:** R03. **Evidence state:** LIVE C-012 + SOURCE; Stage 4/9 execution proof pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** An active enrichment badge and recent zero-record run do not establish expected runtime owner or queue consumption.

**Exact repair:** Publish expected worker profile and role, then collect heartbeat/queue/hold/canary receipts under provider budget controls. Do not reopen completed Stage 4 issues from badge evidence.

**Code:** [server/services/cro03/sfp-runtime-fence.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/server/services/cro03/sfp-runtime-fence.ts). Shared scope and acceptance: R03, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-21 — Dense workspaces bury the rep's next action

**Current verification (Section 13):** PROPOSED WORKFLOW/NAVIGATION UPGRADE; 22 contact and 13 Lead Ops tabs observed.

**Primary repair:** R08. **Evidence state:** LIVE C-021 + SOURCE; proposed upgrade. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Contact shows 22 tabs here; code has 25 literal tabs, three conditional. Lead Ops has 13 and Operator 46 view controls.

**Exact repair:** Apply five-area record view and grouped Lead Ops/Admin navigation below; retain contextual deep links and role boundaries.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactDetail.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R08, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-22 — Large panels and bundles need bounded loading

**Current verification (Section 13):** PERFORMANCE UPGRADE TARGET; current ready queue loading observed, no benchmark certification.

**Primary repair:** R13. **Evidence state:** SOURCE size/old build; performance targets proposed. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Large panels and historical build warnings justify bounded loading investigation.

**Exact repair:** Lazy sections, server pagination and stable errors/cache; measure load, click, query and scroll performance against real large fixture after change.

**Code:** [client/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/App.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R13, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-23 — Provisioning exists but is hard to discover; deactivation must be proved

**Current verification (Section 13):** PROVISIONING EXISTS; discoverability proposal and user lifecycle proof remain open.

**Primary repair:** R02. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + original live; usability upgrade. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Invite/provision capability exists in ActivationPanel; absolute absence claim is false. User lifecycle proof still pending.

**Exact repair:** Expose existing provision-rep and resend invite in User Management; implement/verify recoverable deactivation and reassignment without broadening roles.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/ActivationPanel.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/ActivationPanel.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R02, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-24 — Empty and filtered states confuse missing data with missing matches

**Current verification (Section 13):** CONFIRMED specific Knowledge error-as-empty (V21); universal empty-state/mutation claim not certified.

**Primary repair:** R08. **Evidence state:** Original live partial; source-driven UX upgrade. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Filtered empty, no data and request failure are not consistently differentiated. Some blank validation worked in the original audit.

**Exact repair:** Shared states with active-filter summary, reset, create permission, loading/degraded/retry; verify Cancel has no mutation and Save durable/invalidation behavior.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/Contacts.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/Contacts.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R08, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-25 — Security and training readiness remain explicit follow-up items

**Current verification (Section 13):** CURRENT ADMIN 2FA/PENDING OBSERVED; Knowledge V21 and workflow guard V22 added; Stage 8/9 certification remains open.

**Primary repair:** R11. **Evidence state:** LIVE C-005/C-021; no all-user security conclusion. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Scott admin 2FA warning remains; PCI/knowledge/training evidence is incomplete.

**Exact repair:** Surface explicit remediation owners and workflow docs; verify authorized roles in Stage 3 and carry security/AI/training closure to Stages 8–9.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/SecuritySettings.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/SecuritySettings.tsx). Shared scope and acceptance: R11, metric contracts in Section 7, and action proof in Section 11.

### CRM3-26 — Lifecycle relationship workspace is incomplete

**Current verification (Section 13):** RELATIONSHIP/LIFECYCLE WORKSPACE PROPOSAL; complete linking lifecycle unproved.

**Primary repair:** R08. **Evidence state:** SOURCE + LIVE C-014; complete lifecycle proof pending. **Implementation state:** NOT IMPLEMENTED; runtime closure NOT VERIFIED.

**Reconciliation:** Business suggestions exist but are not verified links; legacy companies and canonical businesses use distinct authorities.

**Exact repair:** Keep verified association provenance; record workspace exposes separate company/business/contact/deal/application/contract/MID IDs and missing/conflicted state. Never merge by display name alone.

**Code:** [client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOps/BusinessDetailPage.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973/client/src/pages/dashboard/LeadOps/BusinessDetailPage.tsx).

## 4. Claims needing verification, and claims no longer accurate

The two reference audits originally resolve to **7 confirmed, 19 partial, 6 disproved, 20 blocked/untested, 3 superseded, 4 expected controls, 8 proposed upgrades, 1 not reproduced and 1 declined recommendation** across 69 claim families. Appendix C preserves these original classifications and gives the current consequence. Fresh evidence strengthens several partial findings without proving every subclaim or historical action; this document does not silently reclassify a whole family as confirmed.

The 20 unverified rows are evidence gaps with specific closure actions, not 20 rejected defects. They include native GHL assertions, alleged past deletes/archives/pauses and untested local action reports. An authenticated local CRM admin session does not supply a native GHL session, another role, mobile viewport, deletion receipts or safe execution fixtures.

The absolute claims of no composer and no invite capability are false: existing capabilities are present. Discoverability and record context still need improvement. “All sections functionally complete” is false. Visually plausible emails do not establish 83% deliverability; numeric/QQ addresses are not intrinsically invalid. The roughly 2,040/2,097 stalled claims use an amplified join and are not authoritative enrollment totals. Redis/OpenAI missing configuration and the old empty Lead Ops/pipeline figures are historical states; a current configured badge still does not prove a successful job/call.

Do not purge consent/audit evidence, start a 532,626-record Sunbiz/provider batch, require Stripe/NMI merely because this is a payments company, or rebuild a capability already present. Confirm underlying business requirements and stage ownership first. PCI self-assessment completion is not PCI certification.

Verification family | Concrete evidence needed | Owner / task
--- | --- | ---
Historical create succeeded but UI returned 500 | Protected fixture, request/response receipt, durable record read after refresh, downstream failure stage and idempotency retry proof | B/D; R03
Delete/archive/bulk/sequence actions | Disposable fixture IDs, pre-state, action, scoped durable post-state, audit, cache and restore; historical receipts for claimed past actions | B/D; R10
Real role ownership and permissions | Distinct approved admin/manager/agent/merchant/partner sessions plus anonymous denial; collection/detail/export/bulk and direct-link tests | A–D; R02/R05
Consent capture/privacy deletion | Purpose/channel/source metadata, isolated local/curl reproduction, retained evidence and protected request lifecycle | B/D; R09
Native GHL claims | Correct native account/location, permissions, observed full IDs, workflow trigger semantics, external before/after and restoration receipts | D; R14
GHL independent no-send sync | Fake transport contract first, then isolated allowlisted native canary with no communications/enrollment trigger; worker heartbeat and one durable sync receipt | A/D; R03
Metrics and suspected fixtures | Explicit record classes, owner/team, archive/delete, status, event-vs-object, timestamp and raw distinct IDs; exclude guesses from aggregates | A/D; R06/R07
Mobile/degraded/performance | 320/390/768/1280/1440 widths, touch/keyboard, actual slow/error/403/503/timeout/retry responses and bounded representative data | C/D; R08/R13
Stages 4–9 obligations | Provider, processor, revenue, attribution, training and release evidence tied to their intended lanes; Stage 3 closes only the CRM contract it actually exercises | D; R11/R14

## 5. Workspace and route reconciliation

Reduce normal employee navigation to **nine principal destinations plus role-gated Administration and a compact Resources menu**. The same capability should have one component owner and one metric authority, even when accessed from several contexts. Preserve current route URLs first; the design removes redundant menu entries and panels, not authorization boundaries or useful deep links. No destructive route removal is authorized by this specification.

The destination table is the proposed default menu. Subpages stay reachable through their area’s local navigation, command search, record context and compatibility aliases. Administration is explicit and role-gated, rather than hidden behind Dev Mode. Hiding a menu is never access control. Merchant and partner portals remain separate identities/workspaces.

Principal destination | Canonical existing entry | Local destinations / reconciliation | Roles
--- | --- | --- | ---
Today | /dashboard for admin/manager; /dashboard/my-day for agent | Prioritized due work, unassigned/team work where permitted, inbound requests, NBA and quick actions. AI Advisor moves to a persistent contextual action. | Admin / manager / agent, scoped
Records | /dashboard/contacts-leads?tab=people | People and Leads; Companies/business associations are contextual views. Agent keeps compatible /contacts and /my-leads authority. Imports live only under Prospecting. | Employee roles under current guards
Pipeline | /dashboard/pipeline | Kanban/list share data; stage rules/configuration via privileged configuration action. | Current employee permissions
Inbox | /dashboard/comms-hub | Channel filters rather than separate SMS/live-chat daily navigation. Global composer + record context. | Current scope
Work | /dashboard/tasks-appointments?tab=tasks | Tasks and Appointments; notifications are header actions, not another daily page to scan. | Current scope
Merchant Operations | /dashboard/portfolio | One local navigation for Applications, Statement Reviews, Documents, Underwriting, Boarding, Onboarding, Risk, Success and Support. Preserve each state and current canonical route. | Admin/manager; agent only permitted portfolio/record work
Prospecting | /dashboard/lead-ops?tab=businesses | Sources, imports/staging, intelligence, quality and program health. Ready for Outreach becomes qualification/audience view; all imports aliases point here. | Admin/manager; agent only authorized intelligence/ready views
Campaigns | /dashboard/outbound-center?tab=campaigns | Manage, Audience, Delivery and Results; local sequences vs native GHL workflows stay explicit. All send/enrollment remains paused. | Admin/manager under ownership rules
Reports | /dashboard/reporting?tab=overview | Sales/Growth, Operations, Outreach and Financial; Leaderboard and My Earnings are subviews with own permitted scope. | Admin/manager; agent permitted earnings/leaderboard
Administration | /dashboard/admin-hub?tab=users | Five groups: Users & Access, Integrations, Operational Controls, Data & Audit, Release Readiness. Security self-service remains reachable separately. | Privileged sections under existing guards
Resources | /dashboard/knowledge-base | Training, playbooks, collateral, contextual help; Content/Widgets/blog/social authoring under privileged Acquisition content tools. | Current roles
External portals | /dashboard/merchant-portal; /dashboard/partner | Separate merchant/partner identity. Partner administration/referrals stays in Merchant Operations local navigation. | Independent scoped portal contracts

### Implementation rules for every existing route

1. Build a typed registry from the current App.tsx inventory containing route pattern, component owner, role/record guard, canonical destination, query schema, menu group, aliases and retirement condition. Suggested new files are `client/src/lib/crm-destinations.ts` and a generated route-coverage fixture; these files do not exist yet.
2. Redirect aliases through that registry. Preserve compatible record ID, owner, search/filter and attribution parameters; normalize selected tab keys deliberately. Do not blindly concatenate duplicate `tab` parameters. Never pass session/secret data into shareable URLs.
3. Keep /contacts/:id, /companies/:id and /lead-ops/business/:id as separate namespaces until a verified identity crosswalk exists. A candidate association is not a verified link.
4. Consolidate duplicate components into the owner shown in Appendix A. Keep thin role-aware wrappers if the shared hub has narrower access. LegacyLeadIntelligenceRedirect/LegacyLeadCommandCenterRedirect currently preserve other-role access; do not replace them with an admin-only redirect.
5. Routes labelled contextual lose top-level menus but retain context-aware entry and a useful standalone fallback. Recordless Call Outcome/Review Complete explain required context.
6. Remove obsolete rendering only after component consumers, tests, notifications, bookmarks, templates and external links are inventoried. Keep a compatible redirect until telemetry/retirement criteria prove it can go. Virtual Terminal currently redirects Home; keep explicit retirement notice rather than presenting an operational payment capability.
7. Canonical Financial destinations use `tab=financial&financialTab=…`. Operator nested views keep `tab=monitor&view=…`. Lead Ops Provider Results must be a valid destination. Browser back/forward/refresh must restore selected panel and filters.
8. Appendix A covers all 146 registered Stage 3 dashboard patterns, not every public or mobile App route. Public Stage 2 routes retain their completed-lane ownership; dedicated /mobile destinations require separate narrow/touch tests.

## 6. Tab and panel reconciliation

### Contact record: 22 observed tabs / 25 source tabs → five areas + activity drawer

Keep identity, ownership, lifecycle, consent/send status and the next permitted action above the fold. One timeline unifies messages, calls, notes and comments with filters; audit history is a separately labelled stream. Cards link to dedicated details when more depth is needed. Lazy-mount inactive areas. Preserve old tab values through a translation map so notification/bookmark links still open the right section.

Existing tab value | Proposed area | Presentation
--- | --- | ---
overview | Overview | Context section; old deep link translated
relationships | Overview | Context section; old deep link translated
locations | Overview | Context section; old deep link translated
company-intelligence | Overview | Context section; old deep link translated
deals | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
tasks | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
call-logs | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
call-assist | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
offer-intelligence | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
sales-prep | Sales Work | Context section; old deep link translated
comm-timeline | Conversations | Context section; old deep link translated
comm-health | Conversations | Context section; old deep link translated
delivery-log | Conversations | Context section; old deep link translated
notes | Conversations | Context section; old deep link translated
comments | Conversations | Context section; old deep link translated

onboarding-stages | Lifecycle | Context section; old deep link translated
rfis | Lifecycle | Context section; old deep link translated
tickets | Service & Performance | Context section; old deep link translated
live-processing | Service & Performance | Context section; old deep link translated
chargebacks | Service & Performance | Context section; old deep link translated
churn-risk | Service & Performance | Context section; old deep link translated
nps | Service & Performance | Context section; old deep link translated
activity | Activity & History drawer | Filtered drawer
history | Activity & History drawer | Filtered drawer

### Lead Ops: 13 top-level tabs → five areas

Existing selection | Proposed area | Behavior
--- | --- | ---
businesses | Inventory | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
prospects | Inventory | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
sources | Sources & Imports | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
imports | Sources & Imports | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
census | Sources & Imports | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
intelligence | Enrichment | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
provider-results | Enrichment | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
staging | Qualification & Staging | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
quality | Qualification & Staging | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
pipeline | Qualification & Staging | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
sfp | Qualification & Staging | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
health | Program Health | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation
pilot | Program Health / Legacy archive | Keep source-specific state; nested selection with old URL compatibility; no provider execution on navigation

Paid Pilot remains a clearly labelled legacy view until consumer/data inventory proves retirement is safe. South Florida Prospecting stays a defined program under qualification/staging; it is not duplicated as a second lead database. Reconciliation runs and association decisions are privileged and evidence-based; ordinary reps see only verified relationships.

Hub | Current selections | Proposed reconciliation
--- | --- | ---
AdminHub (11 tabs) | users, permissions, audit-log, consent, pci, agents, integrations, ghl, info-flow, gate-result, automations | Users & Access: users/agents/permissions. Integrations: integrations/ghl/info-flow. Data & Audit: audit-log/consent/data requests. Release Readiness: pci/gate-result. Operational Controls: automations, round-robin, queue/runtime/deliverability. Preserve exact role visibility.
OutboundCenter (6 tabs) | command, campaigns, sequences, governance, prospects, analytics | Manage: campaigns + sequences. Audience: prospects/qualified-ready, re-engagement explicitly scoped. Delivery: command/governance/deliverability. Results: analytics/sequence-report via shared reporting owner. Distinguish data ready vs permitted to send.
ReportingHub (6) + FinancialHub (3) | overview, growth, win-loss, outreach-analytics, operations, financial; revenue, forecasting, terminal-roi | Four primary areas Sales/Growth, Operations, Outreach, Financial. Keep overview/growth/win-loss as Sales subviews, three financial selections intact and query-normalized. Earnings and leaderboard link contextually.
Operator (46 view controls) | Pipeline & Conversion; SDR & Outreach; AI/Content; Integrations & Sync; Lead Scoring; System Health | Within Operational Controls use four local areas: Runtime & Queues, Integrations, Data Diagnostics, Release & Incidents. Send controls remain privileged; deep diagnostic views preserved as nested controls, not 46 simultaneous navigation choices.
ContactsAndLeads | people, leads | Keep two entity projections backed by a common authority. Do not pretend raw prospect rows and CRM contacts are the same entity.
TasksAppointments | tasks, calendar | Keep two useful modes; shared ownership/filters and due-date contract. Add priority views as saved filters, not new tabs.
CommsHub | Email/SMS/GHL Chat/Voicemail/Site Chat | Channel filters and one message detail; separate provider states, support consistent unread totals and record-context composer.
Merchant Operations hubs | Onboarding, Support, Risk, Success, application/underwriting/boarding | Keep distinct business states in one local navigation and shared record header. A support ticket does not become an underwriting case or a chargeback by consolidation.
Resources/content | Playbooks, Training, Knowledge, ContentHub/blog/social/widgets | Resources for reps; authoring tools for permitted editors. Preserve existing public website/content routes and attribution contracts from Stage 2.

Appendix B retains all 309 observed entries with a proposed owning area. Observations can repeat the same underlying tab through different routes. The tab families above specify concrete consolidation; other leaf sections remain inside their canonical owner rather than receiving new top-level tabs. Every old panel receives a compatible selection or an explicit documented retirement—not a silent fallback.

## 7. Shared metric and data authority contract

Extend `server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts`; do not introduce a second competing reader. Add shared task/enrollment/sync metric functions alongside existing domain authorities where necessary. Proposed new modules, if useful: `server/services/crm-task-read-authority.ts` and `shared/crm-metric-contract.ts`. These are design destinations, not files already implemented.

Every named metric returns **definition/version, subject kind, scope, record classes, owner/team, archive/delete policy, statuses, period/timezone, asOf, source, freshness and availability**. Include exact vs sampled/estimated and denominator where applicable. Responses with unavailable inputs return unavailable/degraded, never authoritative zero. Client query keys include every scope/filter field; lists, counts, charts and exports share the same predicates. Pending and overdue definitions cannot drift between pages.

Default operating views use production records and exclude archived/deleted entities; permitted audit/census views can include other classes with a visible scope banner. Status names normalize at the shared authority, with migration/backward compatibility where required. Use a single captured asOf per comparison; stable fixture checks compare the same actor and scope. Date-only due values need a documented operating timezone; do not infer UTC business deadlines from browser locale.

Metric family | Surfaces | Definition and reconciliation | Existing owner / repair anchor
--- | --- | --- | ---
Contacts | Home / People / census / GHL settings | Distinct contact IDs with shared class/archive/owner filters; selected filter cards match selected list; All-class census separately labelled | revenue-read-authority.ts readPeople/readPeopleFacets; contacts.ts
Businesses / source prospects | Lead Ops / record relationships / staging | Separate canonical businesses, raw source prospects, staging entries and CRM contacts. Count distinct native IDs; verified linkage only | LeadOpsCenter + lead-ops BusinessDetailPage and identity crosswalk
Pipeline deals | Home / Pipeline / Contact Deals / Reports | Distinct active deal IDs scoped by class/owner/archive/status; all-linked-record count labelled separately from active pipeline | analytics.ts / pipeline read authority / contact links
Pending tasks | Home / My Day / task list / Contact Tasks | Live nondeleted tasks in agreed pending statuses and actor scope; unrelated/unlinked task policy explicit; class derived from own metadata/linked entity | storage/tasks.ts + tickets-tasks.ts + analytics.ts
Overdue tasks | Briefing / Home / badges / Tasks | Same actionable task predicate, dueAt < asOf in operating timezone; statuses completed/cancelled/done normalized | daily-briefing.ts and shared task authority
Tickets and SLA | Support / Home / Contact Tickets / Round Robin | Open scoped distinct ticket IDs; breached vs historical breaches separate, eligible assignment vs unassigned explicit | tickets-tasks.ts and assignment/SLA authority
Unread / notifications | Header / Inbox / Notifications / briefing | Distinguish unread conversations/messages/notifications, actor scope, read status and channel. Badge labelled to the exact subject | CommsHub + Notifications + daily briefing reader
Readiness | Home / Lead Ops / Contact / Ready Queue | Data completeness, deliverability and actual permission are separate fields with versioned criteria. Placeholder email excluded | contact-readiness.ts + permission/NBA authority
Enrolled / active / stalled | Sequences / Sequence Report / Operator | Distinct enrollment IDs; aggregate each relation first. Scope by sequence ownership; local vs external workflow enrollment separately labelled | campaigns.ts 1921–2008 + manager 1186–1202
GHL synced / unsynced | GHL settings / Operator / Admin | Distinct eligible local IDs with verified external identity and last success; historical successful sync events not unique entities | ghl-sync.ts and per-entity sync readers
GHL errors / worker status | Integration / Registry / Operator | Current outstanding failures vs cumulative errors separate. Active config distinct from heartbeat, last success, queue consumption | AutomationRegistry / GhlSettings / runtime profiles
Terminal count / ROI | Terminal ROI / Forecast / Portfolio | Proposed, ordered, deployed and active distinctly sourced. Forecast GP explicit; actual payback from residual/cost ledger; no lifecycle inference from recommendation alone | terminal-economics.ts 267–351
Revenue / commissions | Financial / My Earnings / Portfolio | Actual residual/processor ledger period, gross/net/cost/adjustment/commission definitions; no contact*15000 operational revenue | FinancialHub and residual/commission authorities; Stage 6 proof
Re-engagement audience/value | Cold Leads / Campaign Audience / Reports | Dormant production authorized contacts vs abandoned inbound events separated. Source + last touch + age + eligibility; modelled value only labelled scenario | contacts.ts 451–512 and ColdLeads
Activities / funnel conversion | Home / reporting / executive | Event taxonomy and window explicit: 26 Total Actions can include categories beyond calls/email/SMS. Forms3/DealsCreated3 vs active deals2 is not necessarily an arithmetic defect | analytics/briefing/event readers; attribution Stage 7
Training / knowledge / readiness | Training / Resources / Admin diagnostics | Assigned/published/completed distinct; per-user certification not global course count. Probe failed/unavailable distinct from not configured | Training / KnowledgeBase / launch-readiness-full.ts

**Required invariant tests:** (a) selected contacts count equals same-scope total from the list authority; (b) pending/overdue sum and badges use the same fixture/asOf; (c) list/report enrollment counts agree with two steps and three enrollments without 2× multiplication; (d) production views exclude test/demo/synthetic/deleted/archived fixtures as specified; (e) another owner cannot be counted, exported or mutated beyond the intended contract; (f) failed/forbidden/sampled reads do not appear as zero; (g) archive/restore invalidates all affected projections; (h) GHL event counts and local distinct-object counts never share an ambiguous label; (i) forecast/actual equipment and revenue are separate. Do not write equality tests between unlike metric definitions.

## 8. Liberty UI design specification grounded in the repo

Preserve the Liberty navy/blue/red palette, existing blue logo and operational IBM Plex fonts. This is a CRM layout/component refinement, not a rebrand. Scope new typography/density tokens to the authenticated CRM shell. Public marketing uses its existing isolated theme and Source Serif 4 display font; Stage 2 regression checks remain required if any shared primitive changes.

## 9. Productivity improvements and exact action behavior

Workflow | Improvement | Required proof
--- | --- | ---
Start of day | Today queue sorted by due/SLA/priority with owner and next step. Saved Mine/Team/Unassigned views subject to real role scope. | Every card links to same-scope object; counts and list agree; no stale/deleted tasks; degraded advice does not invent urgency or reassurance.
Lead → rep follow-up | Qualified inbox/source record → eligible owner → due task → one record workspace → next step. | Assignment/dedupe/SLA receipt; correct contact/deal links; local refresh shows durable changes; provider pause does not block a safe local note/task.
Record editing | Inline safe fields or focused side panel; preserve filters/scroll/back context. | Field validation, no double-submit, Cancel does not write, retry idempotent, Save durable and all affected projections invalidated.
Calls / notes / tickets | Launch from contact/deal with context and structured outcome; link next step/due task. | Call outcome attached to intended record, owner and timestamp; invalid context explained; no accidental dial/provider spend from navigation.
Inbox | Channel filter + owner queue + conversation detail and contact links; record-context draft. | Unread semantics, reassignment/read durable state, errors shown; reply/send denied while paused with correct reason; draft usable.
Imports / prospecting | One staging owner with source/provenance, quality, promotion preview and conflicts. | Navigation is read-only; no provider calls, promotion or association verification without intended action and safe scope.
Campaign maintenance | Manage content, inspect audience/suppression and preview expected actions while send paused. | No live enrollment/sends; counts distinct; local/native workflow status explicit; archive/cancel restores and invalidates properly.
Merchant handoff | Lifecycle record links to application, docs, underwriting, processor/MID and service where available. | No invented relationship; missing/conflicted link shown; ID-based access and separate Stage5/6 execution evidence.
Bulk operations | Selection bar, impact preview, permitted IDs and recoverable archive/deactivate workflows. | Mixed-owner selection denied or explicit permitted subset contract; atomicity/idempotency/audit/restore; no silent local tag write before authorization.
Admin operations | Provisioning, sync health, queues, privacy and readiness discoverable in five groups. | Real role gates, explicit unavailable states, existing controls retain safety policy, one read-only health authority instead of duplicated optimistic cards.

## 10. Revised implementation roadmap: eight execution tasks

**Revision 2026-10-02:** A, B and D remain the existing grouped scopes. C is now a parent scope delivered through C1–C5, not one Replit build task. There are **eight proposed execution tasks: A, B, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and D**. These labels are planning identifiers; no Replit task numbers have been assigned. The previous four-task packaging is superseded. No finding, route, panel, repair requirement or later-stage obligation is removed by this split.

The interactive Liberty mockup is a design reference with sample data and local interactions. It is not production implementation, proof of live behavior, a complete specification for every retained screen, or authorization to replace real data with sample values. Sections 5–9 and the route/panel registers remain the detailed implementation contract.

### 10.1 Task boundaries and deliverables

| Task | Owned scope and concrete deliverables | Acceptance before handoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — shared authorities, access and sync policy | R01/R02/R03/R06/R07 and non-UI CRM3-05 contracts. Serving-source mapping, reproducible CI, collection/bulk authorization, canonical record/task/metric predicates, campaign aggregation, manager enrollment contract and verify the implemented one-way GHL → database reconciliation; optional provider-write controls remain a separate conditional scope (Section 12). | Class/owner/archive/status fixtures; scoped list/count/export/bulk and aggregation tests; fake transport denies sending/enrollment and permits reviewed noncommunicating sync; native trigger safety only before separately required writes back to GHL, not before incoming reads/local import; required clean CI. Historical private-registry failure remains historical until a fresh install reproduces it. Stage 9 SHA freeze is not required here. |
| B — actionable rep workflow and recoverable lifecycle | R04/R09/R10/R12 plus backend relationships and user operations from R02/R08. Implement durable task/assignment/notification, inbox/draft, contactability, user provisioning, consent/privacy, archive/deactivate/restore and verified lifecycle links. | Protected create/edit/complete/assign/draft/archive/restore receipts; cancellation, retry/idempotency, audit and cache proof; actual role/owner enforcement; no-message assertions. UI discoverability and migration connect to C2/C4/C5 without duplicating these handlers. |
| C1 — route ownership and shared UI foundation | Create the code-owned destination registry for every inventoried route and panel; preserve entity namespace, guard, query/tab translation and consumer links. Establish scoped Liberty tokens and shared page header, metric strip, worklist toolbar, action menu, data-state and integration-status primitives. Define lazy-mount/bounded-table contracts and a representative tested template. | All 146 route patterns and 309 panel entries have explicit disposition/owner; no automatic deletion; alias and invalid-tab contract tests; existing shell/public routes unchanged except intentional tested shared fixes; token/focus/responsive template checks. No new sidebar destination exposed before its content works. |
| C2 — daily sales workspace | Apply the foundation to Today, Records/contact detail, Pipeline, Inbox and Work. Five-area contact workspace, activity/history access, task/record context, filters, same-scope metrics and actionable states. Use A/B handlers rather than rewriting their backend responsibilities. | Scoped metric/list parity; notes/tasks/drafts and record links verified durably against B; filter/back/refresh context; real role visibility, loading/empty/error/no-access states and mobile/keyboard checks for each changed template. |
| C3 — Prospecting and Campaigns | Consolidate Lead Ops into Inventory, Sources & Imports, Enrichment, Qualification & Staging and Program Health. Reconcile Provider Results and local tab URLs; consolidate campaign navigation into Overview, Audience, Content and Results. Preserve source/provider evidence, suppression and staged status. | Provider Results opens the intended panel (CRM3-08); legacy deep links and back/refresh work; campaign metrics use A definitions; drafts/staging distinctions truthful; no provider spend, enrollment or sending caused by navigation. Provider execution and fleet/schedule proof remain Stage 4. |
| C4 — Merchant Operations and Reports | Group existing application/underwriting/processor/MID/onboarding/support destinations, preserving merchant and partner portal boundaries. Apply shared layouts and scoped Reports views; fix Forecasting/Terminal ROI tab translation and distinguish modelled from actual financial values. | CRM3-10 alias and tab tests; verified entity links with no display-name identity inference; scope/as-of/source labels and shared metric contracts; role/mobile/degraded tests. Deep processor/application/post-sale financial execution remains Stages 5–6. |
| C5 — Administration, Resources and shell cutover | Group admin tools into Users & Access, Integrations, Operational Controls, Data & Audit and Release Readiness. Repair Permissions/Queue Holds/Worker Heartbeats diagnostics; consolidate Resources. Activate the 11-entry sidebar (nine workspaces plus Administration and Resources) only after retained destinations pass their gates. | CRM3-06/07/09 diagnostics and DTO contracts; readiness/knowledge truth; independent send/sync states; role-gated discovery plus backend enforcement; link/alias/refresh checks for the entire shell and changed local groups; measured mobile, accessibility, performance and public regressions; reversible cutover. |
| D — integrated reconciliation and Stage 3 closure | Repeat rep/admin journeys against the actual serving build; reconcile all 26 Stage 3 and 69 reference entries; cross-workspace metric invariants, real roles/actions, degraded cases, native GHL obligations and later-stage owners. Update this specification and the go-live ledger with receipts and explicit verdict. | Complete action/role/mobile/degraded matrix; durable post-refresh records; no-send sync canary where authorized and safe; cleanup/restore receipts; source/runtime identity. Critical unresolved workflow/access/sync/metric defects or coverage gaps keep Stage 3 CONDITIONAL/NO-GO. Final release freeze/security certification remains Stage 9. |

### 10.2 Repair ownership inside C

Each source entry retains its primary R01–R14 group in Sections 2–4 and Appendix C. The following table assigns implementation slices, not additional unique findings. Cross-cutting findings can have multiple slices, but one parent finding remains open until all required slices pass.

| Parent group / source entries | Execution owner and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| R05: CRM3-06; Permissions response/coverage | C5 owns diagnostic UI and matching audited API/schema repair. C1 defines route/guard inventory; do not broaden access. |
| R05: CRM3-07; Queue Holds DTO crash | C5 owns typed response normalization, rendering and real empty/error cases; coordinator safety policy remains intact. |
| R05: CRM3-08; Provider Results tab | C3 owns intended local destination; C1 owns shared URL/tab translation contract. |
| R05: CRM3-09; Worker Heartbeats deep link | C5 owns monitor/heartbeats destination and diagnostics; C1 owns compatibility contract. |
| R05: CRM3-10; financial aliases | C4 owns Forecasting/Terminal ROI selected views; C1 owns compatibility contract. |
| R05: REF-004 / REF-058 | C1 records each source subclaim's exact route; C2–C5 repair only the owning workspace slices, retaining partial/unverified qualifications. |
| R08: CRM3-21 / CRM3-24 / CRM3-26; REF-031 / REF-043 / REF-044 / REF-048 / REF-053 / REF-056 | C2 owns record/rep workspace presentation, C4 lifecycle navigation, C5 user/admin/resource discoverability, C1 common layout/route rules. B owns actual relationship/user/lifecycle mutations; exact original allegation determines the slice. |
| R11: CRM3-19 / CRM3-25; REF-013 / REF-054 | C5 owns readiness/knowledge/diagnostic presentation and the audited probe repair; D verifies integrated/live claims. Stage 8 training and Stage 9 security/release obligations retain their lane owners. |
| R13: CRM3-22 | C1 owns shared lazy-loading/pagination rules; C2–C5 implement and measure their page-specific loading behavior. No blanket closure from one template test. |
| A/B groups surfaced in redesigned pages | A/B retain the repair authority; the owning C task integrates and verifies their UI contract. Design changes do not close backend or native-provider allegations. |

Before each C task enters Build, extract an exact owned-route/panel/source-subclaim list from the existing registers. Record old URL, intended destination, retained function/action, guard, legacy translation, metric authority and repair owner. No broad “redesign everything” instruction and no route retired solely because it is visually inconvenient. An unexpectedly large independent subsystem is carried back to the roadmap with evidence before expanding the build scope.

### 10.3 Order and cutover gates

1. Agree destination ownership and metric/permission contracts in A/C1. Nondependent C1 design/component work may proceed while A resolves source provenance; do not claim unproved source fixes are deployed.
2. Complete B's relevant workflow contracts before C2 migrates their UI. C2 should integrate existing proven handlers and keep record context intact.
3. Deliver C3 and C4 against C1 and the applicable A/B contracts. They own separate page/route slices; shared-registry edits must remain coordinated.
4. Deliver C5 after C2–C4 destinations and their acceptance gates are ready. Diagnostic/admin repairs can be prepared earlier; full sidebar cutover waits for functioning targets.
5. D validates the combined serving build, resolves the original claim-by-claim dispositions and issues the Stage 3 verdict.

Each execution task includes its own relevant tests and protected browser verification. D adds cross-workspace evidence; it is not the first action-button test. Use small reviewed commits and reversible navigation flags where appropriate. Keep old links working during migration; preserve public, merchant, partner and role boundaries. No destructive schema drops, identity merges, production purge or access expansion are implied by navigation consolidation.

### 10.4 Required handoff and completion evidence

Every task records: changed code paths; original CRM3/REF identifiers and allegation slices; owned route/panel/action list; exact intended behaviors; meaningful CI/contract/role/browser checks; durable mutation receipts where applicable; serving build identity and post-deploy verification when deployed; rollback/restore path; remaining blocked or later-stage obligations. Update this document and ledger after each task/audit. Merged alone is not Closed. A sample mockup click is not a production action pass.

Outbound email/SMS/sequences remain paused. Incoming GHL → database contact sync is independently required and must not be disabled merely because outbound is paused. Section 12 preserves the implemented no-echo import; native field/trigger review applies only to separately required writes back to GHL. UI migration must never toggle provider budgets, worker schedules, outbound gates or native workflows as a side effect.

**Coverage invariant:** all 95 source entries (CRM3-01–CRM3-26 and REF-001–REF-069), their original evidence states and all 14 repair groups remain intact. Neither 95 nor 14 is a count of unique verified defects. C1–C5 adds delivery boundaries, not findings or new audit passes.

## 11. Every-action and every-surface acceptance protocol

Use the existing route/panel/control registers as the traversal seed. Deduplicate the 8,704 control observations by **component + handler + object type + role + state**, while retaining every distinct branch/context. Do not infer action behavior from a control label or a loaded panel. Each actionable control receives a contract and execution state; repeated buttons using one handler still need representative context plus per-row ownership checks.

Control class | Expected result / proof | Required negative cases
--- | --- | ---
Navigation / tab / card / breadcrumb | Expected canonical URL, selected tab, correct panel, data/record context; refresh/back/forward restoration | Unknown query, legacy link, unauthorized role, nonexistent/archived record; no successful wrong-panel fallback
Filter / sort / saved view / page | Same predicates and denominator across list/count/export; URL/state persists; paging bounded | No matches distinct from no records; cross-user cache leakage; race/retry/stale result
Create / edit / assign / status | Validated request, durable exact record read, audit/owner/due/task links, UI cache invalidation | Cancel/no-op, invalid data, duplicate submit/idempotent retry, unauthorized ID, conflict/timeout/provider failure after local commit
Archive / deactivate / restore | Impact preview, authorized linked scope, soft state, dependency handling, durable post-state and restore audit | Mixed-owner bulk, missing/linked records, already archived, partial failure, repeat request; no audit/consent purge
Call / email / SMS / enrollment / sync | Correct contact/channel/action policy; drafts/local safe work allowed; sends/enrollment denied while paused; reviewed sync alone has isolated receipt | No consent, opted-out/invalid/internal placeholder, spend cap, missing provider, transport failure, epoch changes and external workflow triggers
Export / upload / document / application | Correct authorized population, intended file/record, type/size validation and durable link; protected records only | Other-owner data, wrong class, invalid file, timeout, duplicate and partial response; Stage5/6 provider sandbox boundaries
Refresh / AI / diagnose / configuration | Freshness/asOf and availability truth; side effects explicit; facts match authority; settings only changed within authorized task | 403/503/no data/missing config/stale heartbeat/rate-limit; no successful-zero fallback or expensive work on mere page load

**Execution matrix:** Admin, Manager, Agent, Merchant, Partner and anonymous/direct-link contracts; assigned-to-me vs another owner vs unassigned; production/test/demo/synthetic/unknown; current/archived/deleted; loading/success/empty/no-match/error/forbidden/degraded/stale; desktop1440 and1280, tablet768, phone390 and320; pointer/touch/keyboard/zoom.

For each result record source claim/group, route/tab, role, fixture ID/class, handler/API, timestamp/build identity, pre-state, action, expected/actual result, durable after-refresh outcome, audit/correlation receipt and cleanup/restore state. Statuses: **UNTESTED → VERIFIED PASS / CONFIRMED DEFECT / PARTIAL / BLOCKED**, with reason. Bug repair follows **OPEN → IN PROGRESS → MERGED → DEPLOYED → RUNTIME VERIFIED → CLOSED**. Do not move an untested action to PASS based on code alone.

Stage 3 GO requires functioning daily rep/admin routes, scoped metrics, safe role boundaries, actionable assignment/task/inbox workflows, deliberate navigation reconciliation and independent safe GHL sync with outbound paused. Later-lane obligations remain individually visible. The original route inventory alone cannot meet this gate.

## 12. GHL repair reconciliation — 2026-10-02 follow-up

**This follow-up supersedes current-tense GHL conclusions from the earlier baseline where explicitly stated below. Original observations and source references remain historical evidence. No original entry is deleted or counted again.**

### 12.1 Reviewed source and serving evidence

The original reviewed source was `51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973`. Fresh fetch now places main at `07898f15d242a8e75aae4aef7ad89b223c7912b9`. The GHL changes are introduced by `2b276db` (control/runtime/truth and UI repair) and `7e9b8425b6ab61c454b59b9a8d8f315bd0dd4d68` (one-way incoming contact sync). The follow-up is a focused review of GHL changes, not re-certification of every intervening enrichment change or all 95 entries.

The public `https://dev.libertybancard.com/api/health` response during this review reported status `ok`, SHA `7e9b8425b6ab61c454b59b9a8d8f315bd0dd4d68`, builtAt `2026-10-02T16:51:26.540Z`, environment `production`, publishBuildId `7d09a107-0a12-41ac-9f36-06b6d7f04757`, and ghlTransportFailFast `false`. That SHA exists in fetched Git history and is an ancestor of current main. The main changes after it are not the GHL repair itself. This supplies a serving/source association for the new repair; it does not prove worker ownership, sync completion, fresh native review, outbound-pause state, or all backend settings. The earlier missing source for serving SHA `26a7da8...` remains a historical gap, not a claim about the current health-reported build.

### 12.2 What the repair actually implements

**Current contact-sync direction is GHL → Liberty database.** The new flow reads provider contacts, prepares a durable preview, matches by GHL ID or normalized email with collision checks, preserves existing nonblank local values, fills missing first/last name, email, phone and company name, links the external contact ID, and adds identifiable unmatched contacts through canonical local-only intake. It does not create a verified canonical business relationship, qualify a cold-outreach recipient, infer consent, or populate every possible provider field.

Incoming apply uses a preview hash, actor/idempotency checks, durable leased progress, pagination validation, transaction-scoped identity rechecks, and the current paused outbound epoch. The `ghl_inbound_no_echo` writer/hook policy prevents GHL projection and downstream side-effect hooks in this path. The ongoing contact-webhook lane has its own switch. Import counts distinguish scanned/matched/would-update/would-create from actually updated/created. Preview, switch-on and configured credentials are not completion evidence.

Separately, the preceding repair adds explicit read/CRM-write/permission-write/communication capability classification, independent GHL write controls, selected-runtime fencing, native workflow/field review and epoch rechecks for future writes back to GHL. Communication/enrollment and unknown operations retain outbound authorization. **Those provider-write review requirements must not be made prerequisites for the incoming read/local-apply flow.** Current one-way requirements do not call for enabling GHL record writes.

The isolated `ghl-sync-only` queue/profile can exclude enrollment recovery and voicemail and avoids SFP selector changes. Settings and Automation Registry now distinguish connection probe, registry history, control state and runtime evidence. The old broad “All Systems Healthy” claim is replaced in GhlSettings by “GHL API connected (health probe)” with probe timestamp and historical-failure wording.

### 12.3 Exact effect on original findings

| Original entry | Revised disposition / repaired slice | Remaining closure requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM3-03 / R03 | **SOURCE REPAIR IMPLEMENTED; serving health reports repair SHA; LIVE OPERATION NOT VERIFIED.** Undifferentiated send-pause gating is superseded for reviewed CRM writes, and the required incoming contact-sync flow now exists. The old registry “killed” row is explicitly historical metadata and cannot alone prove incoming sync is off. | Verify production preview/apply receipt, exact durable local changes, no provider write/send/enrollment, conflict handling and webhook receipt/control. Future GHL writes are a separate conditional scope. |
| CRM3-04 / R03 | **PARTIAL SOURCE REPAIR IMPLEMENTED.** Honest connection label, checked-at/cached status, runtime/control endpoint and unknown/error handling are present. | Verify rendered live states, independent incoming/write/send controls, actual work/heartbeat and failure freshness. Broad total/linked/unsynced counts still are not a qualified audience or one-to-one parity proof. |
| CRM3-01 / R01 | **CURRENT serving/source association established by health-reported accessible commit; full delivery closure still pending.** | Clean reproducible install/CI and required build receipts remain open. No Stage 9 freeze introduced. No assumption that every current-main change is published. |
| CRM3-02 / R01 | **Historical dependency-install failure unchanged.** The GHL repair does not prove a clean install or reproduce the old private-URL failure. | Fresh supported-registry clean CI; retain historical/current distinction. |
| CRM3-20 / R03 | **GHL-specific runtime ownership controls improved in source; SFP/provider execution claim remains unverified.** | Live owner/queue/work receipts for the relevant lane; no enrichment success inference from GHL sync. |
| REF-008 / D8 | **PARTIALLY REMEDIATED IN SOURCE.** Sync control/direction and diagnostics improved; old killed/backlog/mapping observations retained as historical. | New production inbound result, current scoped backlog/duplicates and explicit stage semantics; do not rebuild the incoming flow. |
| REF-009 / D9 | **PARTIALLY REMEDIATED IN SOURCE.** GHL registry kill-switch state now explicitly separated from runtime-owner evidence. | Current independent automation/runtime status. No permission to enable all killed automations. |
| REF-069 | **PARTIAL, WITH NEW reconciliation mechanism.** Incoming preview/import can produce traceable contact-match/create receipts. | Current local/GHL populations, IDs and field receipts; other workflows/users/forms/phones/stages comparisons remain separate and unverified. |
| REF-003 | **PARTIAL; not closed by incoming contact import.** The new no-echo path does not establish the previously alleged local-create/post-commit HTTP failure is repaired. | Protected create/replay/post-commit integration failure fixture. |
| REF-041 / REF-017 / R07 mapping obligations | **Not closed.** Current repair does not require equal stage counts or populate every legacy workflow ID. Title-derived auto-stage mapping remains disallowed. | Explicit semantic stage/ID/direction contracts for retained workflows; external account evidence where needed. |
| REF-014 / REF-015 | **Previous superseded-configuration qualifications unchanged.** | OpenAI execution/indexing and Redis queue-consumption proofs are independent of this repair. |

No original finding is marked fully runtime-closed in this follow-up. That is a verification limit, not a conclusion that the repairs do not work. Six focused suites passed; production database/provider mutations were not executed during this review.

| Focused suite rerun | Result / limit |
| --- | --- |
| scripts/test-ghl-capability-policy.ts | PASS: classified capabilities, deny cases, review/control and runtime-selection assertions. |
| scripts/test-ghl-truth-utils.ts | PASS: command/error/unknown-state utility checks. |
| scripts/test-ghl-inbound-sync.ts | PASS: focused sanitization, fill-missing, identity conflict and source-boundary checks. |
| scripts/test-ghl-inbound-route-guards.ts | PASS: 42 actual middleware auth/role checks and five input-validation checks without service mutations. |
| scripts/test-ghl-sync-runtime-boundary.ts | PASS: isolated GHL profile/queues, owner fencing, no title-derived mapping or SFP selector mutation. |
| scripts/test-ghl-inbound-sync-ui.tsx | PASS: ten static UI state checks with its dedicated JSX configuration; not a browser-action test. |

Tests used Node 24, the available dependency tree, NODE_ENV=test and an explicitly nonworking localhost database URL. The tsx CLI first failed on its IPC socket; `node --import tsx` ran the suites. The UI test required its checked-in `scripts/tsconfig.ghl-inbound-ui-test.json`; the unconfigured first attempt is not a production React defect. No server/worker bootstrap was started and no production DB/provider transport was exercised. The disposable-PostgreSQL integration suite exists but was not run here because no migrated disposable database was provisioned; full stock CI/build and live browser verification are not claimed.

### 12.5 Revised task scope: preserve the repair, verify and integrate it

**A:** Do not author a second GHL sync system. Treat source separation and incoming preview/apply as implemented. Verify the production one-way flow, protected-field preservation, actual local results, conflict/duplicate outcomes, webhook control/receipt and no-send/no-echo behavior. Incoming reads/local writes do not depend on native provider-write review. Leave optional writes back to GHL disabled unless separately required. Maintain metric/access/CI work not repaired by this change.

**B/C2:** Show imported field provenance and correct record context; incoming contact sync is not proof of canonical business links, owner assignment, consent or outreach qualification. Preserve B's remaining workflows and lifecycle obligations.

**C5:** Reuse the new incoming/control/truth components within Integrations/Operational Controls instead of replacing them with placeholder UI or rebuilding them. Keep direction-specific labels: Incoming contact updates, Optional GHL record writes, Outbound communications. A legacy registry switch is historical metadata, not the primary activation affordance for the new incoming flow.

**D:** Verify a completed production import and actual signed incoming update receipt, durable after-refresh local values and absence of provider writes/sends/enrollment. Reconcile scopes rather than forcing unlike numbers to match. Current build association is now available; final release certification remains Stage 9.

The eight-task plan and 95-source-entry/14-group coverage remain. This review reduces remaining GHL implementation scope; it does not introduce another build task or declare the complete GHL/native integration closed.

## Appendix A. Complete 146-pattern route destination register

All decisions below are proposed. URL strings in this specification are code destinations, not proof of a successful browser visit. Current route guards come from the original App.tsx inventory; every real role still requires verification. No route is marked deleted. MERGE means shared presentation/component ownership with compatibility, not merging entity IDs. LEAF pages remain within their stated local navigation area.

## Appendix B. Complete 309 observed panel-entry reconciliation

Each original panel/control entry is retained with its owning area. Existing URL/query values are compatibility inputs. This is an observation register, not 309 distinct component implementations or functional passes. Old UI evidence IDs refer to October 1; fresh C-IDs are in the evidence bundle. Mutations/other roles/mobile remain unproved unless separately recorded. For nested forms/filters outside the major tab families, retain the section within its canonical owner and verify its distinct handler.

## Appendix C. Reconcile every finding from the two reference audits

This section is the explicit bottom-of-plan verification and reconciliation requirement. D/DEV/G labels follow the source reports; unnumbered narrative claim families receive stable REF IDs. Every row is linked to a common repair scope without discarding its original claim or evidence gap. A primary group prevents duplicate task ownership; related groups are called out in the detailed repairs and acceptance.

The disposition column preserves the original Stage 3 reconciliation. The current consequence incorporates the fresh baseline: historical zeros/configuration states do not become current defects; partially confirmed families retain their unproved subclaims. **No cleanup recommendation is execution authorization.**

Trace ID / source claim | Primary group | Original disposition | Current consequence | Original evidence / exact next verification
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
REF-001 — D1 Setup test email 409 | R12 | EXPECTED CONTROL | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Pause/isolation policy remains. No test email sent. Clarify explanation; Stage 4 fake transport/fixture proof.
REF-002 — D2 Outbound health test blocked | R12 | EXPECTED CONTROL | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Global pause observed; static gate tests pass. Do not unpause to make a test succeed.
REF-003 — D3 Create returns 500 after commit | R03 | PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Current local-first/idempotent 201/202 path exists; blank validation passes. Post-commit orchestration exception remains a boundary to test. Need protected successful create/replay/GHL failure fixture; no “fixed verified” claim.
REF-004 — D4 Permissions zero | R05 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Fresh C-005 repeats zero route census; R05 repair remains. | CRM3-06; Express 5 registry mismatch demonstrated.
REF-005 — D5 Tasks totals disagree | R04 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Fresh C-001/C-003 repeats list/KPI/briefing contradiction. | CRM3-05; now one visible future task, 3,073 pending KPI, 3,072/3,082 overdue views.
REF-006 — D6 Empty pipeline/old deal notices | R06 | PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | Fresh C-019 shows two current pipeline records; old zero superseded. Linked record vs active scope still needs reconciliation. | CRM3-11; production pipeline zero/all-scope 1,572, historical notifications. Current IDs/classes/tombstones need reconciliation; no fake-deal restore.
REF-007 — D7 Partial Inbox | R12 | PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Unified source coverage is explicit; provider ingestion/completeness cannot be certified from loaded rows. Controlled source/cursor tests pending.
REF-008 — D8 Sync killed/backlog/stage mapping | R03 | PARTIAL SOURCE REPAIR; LIVE CLOSURE PENDING (Section 12) | Section 12 supersedes old killed/gating/health conclusions; verify the implemented incoming flow rather than rebuild it. Fresh C-010/C-012: GHL killed, stale/errors/backlog and 2/19 local mapping; sync/send policy separation required. | CRM3-03/04; 1,915 synced, 152,467 unsynced. Eligible audience and native stage semantics still pending.
REF-009 — D9 12/20 automations killed | R03 | PARTIAL SOURCE REPAIR; LIVE CLOSURE PENDING (Section 12) | Section 12 supersedes old killed/gating/health conclusions; verify the implemented incoming flow rather than rebuild it. Fresh registry is 12/19 killed, not 12/20; killed send automations may be expected, data/SLA owners separate. | Current registry **12/19 killed**, some active jobs stale; CRM3-18/20. Not permission to enable all jobs.
REF-010 — D10 Seven unassigned SLA tickets | R04 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Fresh task and pipeline unassigned items strengthen routing gap but do not validate seven old ticket corrections. | Seven displayed; source's corrected subjects take precedence over its earlier unsupported “real” identities. CRM3-18.
REF-011 — D11 Sequences/test/GHL/stalled counts | R07 | PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Sequence catalogue/legacy IDs exist; aggregate join inflates membership counts, CRM3-16/17. Missing all 39 IDs is not automatically a live local-sequence dependency.
REF-012 — D12 Localhost/curl consent log | R09 | BLOCKED OR UNTESTED | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. Still requires direct fixture/native/historical receipt proof; not denied. | Consent surface inspected; event-class/eligibility effect and historical receipts not reconciled. Preserve immutable history; reject purge-by-IP/UA recommendation.
REF-013 — D13 PCI 0/12 | R11 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | The page is not independent PCI certification. Saved assessment/evidence and actual scope remain later-lane work.
REF-014 — D14 OpenAI missing/405/no embeddings | R03 | SUPERSEDED STATE | Current config is not proof of a successful OpenAI call; old missing state superseded. | Current readiness says configured/connected; Knowledge Admin sources zero. No actual governed model call/indexing pass. CRM3-25, Stage 8.
REF-015 — D15 Redis missing | R03 | SUPERSEDED STATE | Configured Redis is not worker/queue consumption proof. | Current readiness says connected and queues render. DLQ/heartbeat/worker receipts are not established by that badge. CRM3-04/20.
REF-016 — D16 Cap 30/missing SMTP | R12 | PARTIALLY CONFIRMED | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | SMTP now configured/connected in readiness, while sequence report disagrees. Transport delivery/fallback not exercised; cap unchanged; no raising limits.
REF-017 — D17 0/39 workflow IDs | R07 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Retain original qualification and perform the evidence action below before closure. | Legacy wizard 0/39; current integration contracts show their own requirements. Map actual inbound versus local-owned cadence dependencies. CRM3-04.
REF-018 — D18 Test rows/users/sequences | R06 | CONFIRMED CURRENT | Fresh C-023 explicitly shows 402 Test, 154005 Production; use class-aware scope, no purge. | 402 Test contacts currently, 28 visible users including fixtures; class leakage/scopes remain CRM3-11/18/23. No cleanup executed.

REF-069 — Local/GHL contacts/stages/workflows/users/forms/phones comparison | R03 | PARTIAL SOURCE REPAIR; LIVE CLOSURE PENDING (Section 12) | Section 12 supersedes old killed/gating/health conclusions; verify the implemented incoming flow rather than rebuild it. Fresh local counts/classes/events and mapping counts have different scopes; semantic contracts required. | Separate authority, eligible population and semantic purpose. CRM displays 154,382 total contacts, 17 workflows, 28 users; native GHL corresponding current counts are not proved. No forced parity.

### Final reconciliation gate for the reference reports

For every REF row, attach a verified outcome or a specific remaining blocker, the original allegation/subclaim, repair group, changed code/PR/build if applicable, live evidence and task/lane owner. Disproved/superseded/expected-control rows stay in the document with their rationale; their related usability improvements still receive acceptance. Historical action claims close only with action receipts or explicit inability to establish them. Publish the Stage 3 verdict only after the role/action/mobile/metric/sync matrix is complete, and update the same go-live ledger after each task and audit.

**Current verdict:** Stage 3 discovery and reconciliation are complete at the documented scope. Implementation and full functional certification are **NOT COMPLETE**. Existing confirmed workflow, authorization, sync-policy, route/diagnostic and metric defects prevent an unconditional Stage 3 GO. Stages 1–2 remain recorded as completed/fixed/merged in the go-live sequence; this document does not replace their evidence. Stages 4–8 follow, Stage 9 freezes/certifies one release, and Stage 10 issues the nine separate lane verdicts.



## 13. Current live and source verification — 2026-10-02

**Authoritative current disposition:** this section supersedes conflicting baseline statements in Sections 1–4, 12 and Appendix C. The older observations remain historical evidence. This is an audit result, not implementation authorization to activate communications or a claim that all CRM actions passed.

### 13.1 Serving source, safety and evidence boundary

- Reviewed main: `74c15805a5cbdb3e0a82183c8c56104999075671`; production health serves `4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8`, built `2026-10-02T20:12:06.875Z`, publish ID `88034800-7804-4deb-8a1a-be20a2c279fd`. Exact serving commit is accessible and has no file-content diff to reviewed main. CRM3-01's old inaccessible-source allegation is superseded for this build. This is not Stage 9 SHA freeze/certification.
- Signed-in cloud CRM session: Scott/admin, desktop. Native GHL remained at sign-in; the secure authentication handoff did not complete. No other real role session or mobile/touch viewport was available for certification.
- Outbound remains **Paused**; ongoing incoming GHL webhook updates remain **Enabled**. Auto-send proposals remains Hold for Review. No provider send, enrollment, purchase, production purge, workflow activation, source repair, merge or deployment was performed.
- Current GHL incoming run fails after reading 3,994 with `GHL_INBOUND_PAGINATION_INVALID`. Connection probe success is not import success; incoming Enabled is not a successful webhook receipt. Keep incoming enabled while repairing pagination and proving local-only writes.
- Production health status ok is observed; complete DB/Redis/worker/queue recovery and role/IDOR certification are not inferred from it.

### 13.2 Confirmed defect register — 22 distinct repair causes

These 22 entries deduplicate the specific confirmed repair causes below. A cause can map to several original source rows; a composite source row can contain both proved and unproved allegations. This is **not a final count of every possible defect across all 95 claims**. Source/middleware-only confirmations are explicitly labeled and are not live exploits. Four repair causes are newly traced in this pass: V16 incoming pagination failure, V17 consent event labels, V21 knowledge query failure and V22 workflow authorization. V18–V20 sharpen existing reference claims rather than add duplicate source rows. All 95 original source entries and 14 broad repair groups remain intact; there are no 95 independent verified defects.

ID | Original entries / group | Task | Confirmed failure and proof | Exact source destinations | Exact repair / closure
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
V01 — Stock dependency installation fails on a private package URL | CRM3-02 / R01 | A | Fresh npm ci failed with 502 fetching undici-7.30.0.tgz from package-firewall.replit.internal. This is a reproducibility defect in this environment, not proof the deployed app failed. | [package-lock.json](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/package-lock.json) | Regenerate a supported, portable lockfile without changing package intent; run supported Node 22/npm 10 stock CI. Do not certify the audit dependency install.
V02 — Home task counts include deleted work | CRM3-05; REF-045 / R04 | B | Live Home pending 3,075 / overdue 3,072; briefing overdue 3,082; Tasks All shows 3 pending, all due October 6. Overview and briefing omit the deleted_at filter used by task storage. | [server/routes/analytics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/analytics.ts); [server/routes/daily-briefing.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/daily-briefing.ts); [server/storage/tasks.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/storage/tasks.ts) | Use the same actor, record class, deletion, status and as-of predicates for actionable task cards, briefing and lists; compare a deleted/overdue fixture.
V03 — AI briefing contradicts its own overdue facts | CRM3-05; REF-045 / R04 | B | AI says no immediate tasks or overdue alerts while the briefing displays 3,082 overdue. generateAiBriefing omits the computed overdueTaskCount from its input. | [server/routes/daily-briefing.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/daily-briefing.ts) | Pass canonical actionable overdue count and degraded/pause reasons; constrain generated claims and render a deterministic factual fallback.
V04 — Permissions Audit falsely returns no routes | CRM3-06; REF-004 / R05 | C5 | Settled live view shows 0 of 0 registered API routes. Extractor reads app._router.stack in an Express 5 application. | [server/routes/permissions-audit.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/permissions-audit.ts) | Use an explicit route registry or supported Express 5 traversal, include mounted guards and fail unavailable when extraction unexpectedly yields zero.
V05 — Queue Holds crashes | CRM3-07 / R05 | C5 | Live error details: (t.desiredLogicalHolds ?? []).map is not a function. Server returns a keyed Record; client declares an array. | [client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/queue-holds.tsx); [server/routes/admin.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/admin.ts) | Share and validate the DTO; deliberately render Record entries or normalize to an array; preserve desired/actual/error distinction.
V06 — Operator child navigation loses the parent tab | CRM3-09 / R05 | C1/C5 | Worker Heartbeats click changes system-health?tab=monitor to system-health?view=worker-heartbeats and selects System Readiness. | [client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/OperatorDashboard.tsx) | Preserve tab=monitor and owned filters in a shared route builder; check click, deep link, reload and back.
V07 — Financial alias selects the wrong report | CRM3-10 / R05 | C1/C4 | Fresh /dashboard/forecasting lands on financial-hub?tab=forecasting with Revenue Dashboard selected. The nested Terminal ROI tab works when selected explicitly. | [client/src/App.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/App.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/FinancialHub.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/FinancialHub.tsx) | Normalize legacy aliases to the reporting financial tab plus correct financialTab; preserve a redirect rather than deleting bookmarks.
V08 — People KPIs and list use unlabeled different record scopes | CRM3-11; REF-006/069 / R06 | A/C2 | Contacts KPI 154,414 all classes versus Production list 154,012; Test 402 accounts for the difference. Home production count 154,012 matches. The difference itself is expected; unlabeled cross-scope comparison is the defect. | [server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/revenue-read-authority.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactsAndLeads.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/ContactsAndLeads.tsx) | Bind operational cards to the active list authority or label all-class census explicitly; expose filters, inclusion rules and as-of time. Do not force GHL/native populations to equal local totals.
V09 — Terminal recommendations are labeled deployed assets | CRM3-12 / R06 | A/C4 | Live report says Deployed 10 and Invested $7,990; test/QA DO NOT BOARD and New Lead rows appear. Server counts recommendations as deployment and uses estimated GP/time for payback. | [server/routes/terminal-economics.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/terminal-economics.ts) | Separate recommended/ordered/deployed with deployment receipts and production/archive filters; actual payback comes from cash-flow evidence; forecasts disclose assumptions.
V10 — Internal no-email placeholder earns full email readiness points | CRM3-13; REF-051 / R12 | B/C2 | Contact 159443 gets Email Present 25/25 for a no-email.libertybancard.internal placeholder. NBA correctly blocks outbound pause; this is completeness scoring, not proof email is permitted. | [server/services/contact-readiness.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/contact-readiness.ts) | Exclude internal placeholder domains; show completeness, validation, consent and channel permission as separate facts and reuse authoritative blockers.
V11 — Cold-lead collection and selected-ID mutation omit agent ownership | CRM3-14 / R02 | A/B | Actual cold-lead handler plus upstream object guard/dashboard middleware exposes an other-owner fixture to an agent-shaped request; bulk-re-engage source tags body-supplied contacts before enrollment. No live other-user mutation or durable role session was tested. | [server/routes/contacts.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/contacts.ts); [server/services/crm-object-access.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/crm-object-access.ts) | Scope collection SQL and authorize every selected contact before any update; deny mixed unauthorized selections and test real role sessions. Preserve outbound pause.
V12 — Cold-lead estimated value is an unsupported fixed multiplier | CRM3-15 / R06 | A/C2 | Current cold-leads handler computes total * 15000 without conversion/revenue evidence and selects dormant sourced contacts rather than proven abandoned forms. | [server/routes/contacts.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/contacts.ts); [client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/ColdLeads.tsx) | Rename the audience to its actual predicate; remove the revenue claim or present editable forecast assumptions and probability separately.
V13 — Sequence-report join multiplies steps and enrollments | CRM3-16; REF-011 / R07 | A/B | Actual repository SQL against a disposable fixture with 2 steps and 3 enrollments returns 6 for both counts. Live global totals 420 active / 552 completed differ from amplified stalled Contacts 2,097. | [server/routes/campaigns.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/campaigns.ts) | Aggregate steps and enrollments independently before joining, use identity-qualified counts and reconcile against enrollment lists. Do not treat amplified counts as deletions or stalled unique people.
V14 — Manager sequence enrollment client and API disagree | CRM3-17 / R07 | B/C3 | Source client requests global enrollments without sequenceId; actual manager request-shaped handler/middleware test returns 403. Server requires an owned sequenceId; client defaults failed query data to an empty array. Live manager session remains untested. | [client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/Sequences.tsx); [server/routes/campaigns.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/campaigns.ts) | Use per-owned-sequence reads or a scoped summary, retain server ownership checks and render forbidden/unavailable instead of zero.
V15 — Readiness probes reference absent schema columns | CRM3-19; REF-013 / R11 | C5/D | users.deleted_at and documents.document_type references each fail 42703 against the current generated-schema fixture. Full migration and live probe suites were not certified. | [server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/launch-readiness-full.ts); [shared/schema.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/shared/schema.ts) | Repair queries to schema-owned fields, fix task status/deletion semantics, and validate every probe against canonical migrations with explicit unavailable states.
V16 — Current one-way GHL reconciliation import fails pagination validation | CRM3-03; REF-008/069 / R03 | A | Live persisted run b9289cb4-c35e-4930-925a-f66ff03a08a2: Import failed; read 3,994, actual matched/updated/added 0; error GHL_INBOUND_PAGINATION_INVALID. Incoming webhook control is Enabled and outbound Paused. | [server/services/ghl-inbound-sync.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/ghl-inbound-sync.ts) | Capture sanitized pagination metadata and API version for that failed run, implement the observed valid pagination contract with host/scope bounds, test multi-page completion/idempotency, then verify actual local receipts with no provider echo or sending. The exact provider payload was not available; numeric-nextPage is a code-branch candidate, not a proved payload root cause.
V17 — Consent Audit labels unrelated event kinds as Opt Out | REF-012; CRM3-24 / R09/R08 | B/C5 | Live total Opt Outs 0 while many rows display Opt Out. Client counts action=opt_out but badges every non-opt_in event Opt Out. Decision/reachability/canonical fact event kinds exist. | [client/src/pages/dashboard/ConsentAudit.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/ConsentAudit.tsx); [server/services/consent-authority.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/services/consent-authority.ts) | Use typed action and record-kind labels, separate canonical consent facts from decisions/reachability, and apply the same taxonomy to filters/counts. Preserve IP/UA and audit provenance. This does not prove zero actual opt-outs or missing consent enforcement.
V18 — Sequence report makes fixed claims about runtime delivery | REF-011/016; CRM3-04 / R07/R12 | C3/C5 | Live copy says active sequences are live and will fire on trigger and SMTP fallback is not configured, despite global outbound pause; these strings do not read pause/runtime provider settings. | [client/src/pages/dashboard/SequenceReport.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/SequenceReport.tsx) | Render configured state and effective execution state separately from current authorities; distinguish paused, eligible, denied and unavailable. Keep the observed daily cap 30 unless an independently approved capacity plan changes it.
V19 — Stale notification deep link silently opens an unrelated current pipeline | REF-049 / R04 | B/C2 | Fresh old notice target /dashboard/pipeline?id=1815 opens the current two-deal list without that target or an unavailable explanation. Pipeline only selects an ID found in its loaded list. Header/page unread 3,822 match; total 4,906 is a different metric. | [client/src/pages/dashboard/Notifications.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/Notifications.tsx); [client/src/pages/dashboard/Pipeline.tsx](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/client/src/pages/dashboard/Pipeline.tsx) | Resolve an authorized target independent of list filters, or show unavailable/archived with a safe contextual destination. Do not infer target deletion solely from a filtered list.
V20 — Deleting a paused sequence with steps fails its foreign key | REF-027 / R10 | B/C3 | Actual createFollowUpSequence/createSequenceStep/deleteFollowUpSequence on disposable current schema produces 23503 and retains the parent row. Schema FK has no delete cascade; storage deletes only the parent. | [server/storage/automation.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/storage/automation.ts); [shared/schema.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/shared/schema.ts); [server/routes/campaigns.ts](https://github.com/scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM/blob/4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8/server/routes/campaigns.ts) | Use a governed archive or transactional draft/paused deletion with child and enrollment/evidence policies; preserve provider/send receipts. Return an explicit blocked reason when historical dependencies prohibit deletion.
V21 — Knowledge sources fail and masquerade as empty | REF-054; CRM3-24/25 / R11/R08 | B/C5 | Live Knowledge Admin stats 16 sources / 16 published / 16 chunks, but Sources (0) and No knowledge sources yet.

V22 — Workflow create/update/run lack management role authorization | REF-056; CRM3-14/25 / R02/R11 | A/B | Registered create/update/run routes use isAuthenticated, tagged any-authenticated.

### 13.3 Verified improvements and allegations not reproduced

- **CRM3-08 Provider Results navigation is closed for the tested click/deep-link/reload path.** Tab selects the actual Discovery Classification/ZeroBounce panel at `lead-ops?tab=provider-results`, and reload retains selection. VALID_TABS and TabsContent now include the destination. This does not certify paid provider execution, every filter or the full Stage 4 lane. Do not rebuild this repaired tab.
- **CRM3-03 separation and CRM3-04 top-level health wording are implemented and observed live.** Incoming Enabled / outbound Paused are separate; the label now says Connected (health probe) with check time/latency. Successful import remains open as V16; stale entity-ledger totals are historical records, not all current failures.
- Contact Archive/Restore actual storage persists and produces audit receipts in the disposable fixture. Governed test-class bulk snapshot/preview/delete with actual route middleware succeeds and idempotent retry returns the same operation. Production-class execute rejection also passes. These component/handler tests supersede blanket no-op claims at that level, but are not production browser save/reload certification.
- Current contact More Actions opens a menu containing Archive without opening detail. Workflow Edit opens editable fields and Cancel closes after its animation; no save occurred. Known test-contact search succeeds.
- Notifications unread header equals page unread; unread versus total is an intentional distinction. Production contacts equals Home production contacts; all-class minus production equals the 402 test records. Do not “fix” these expected differences by deleting records.
- Native stage strategy is now explicit_IDs_only, with all nine local stages not explicitly mapped. Historical truncated duplicate Closed Won/Lost mapping is superseded. Agree semantic mappings rather than force local and native pipeline counts equal.

### 13.4 All 40 previously unresolved reference rows — individual disposition

Each row below has now received a concrete verification attempt or explicit evidence/access check. An attempt does not convert missing evidence into a pass. **1** original row has a fully confirmed specific defect; **16** remain composite partial (with separately confirmed subclaims where stated); **3** earlier behaviors were not reproduced in current UI/disposable components; **4** are configuration/workflow/upgrade observations; **6** require exact historical/fixture/cohort evidence; **10** require native GHL access. The 16 partial rows include native/historical subclaims; those numbers describe source-row status, not unique defects. No claim is denied merely because an example is absent.

Reference | Current disposition | Evidence, scope and remaining requirement
--- | --- | ---
REF-003 | UNVERIFIED | Manual Create opens and validates blank state; no persisted production create. The alleged post-commit 500 requires original request/response/contact IDs and an isolated full orchestration fixture. Current incoming import repair does not prove this separate endpoint.
REF-006 | PARTIAL | Pipeline has 2 current deals; callback detail shows 3 related deals. Different archive/class/list predicates are plausible and traced; do not call all 3 duplicate or lost. Reconcile IDs and scopes before closure.
REF-007 | PARTIAL | Unified Inbox renders 20 cards, 8 non-voicemail on page plus 12 voicemails, with explicit partial-source warning. Email filter renders unavailable/incomplete rather than a confirmed empty inbox. Provider ingestion/completeness remains unproved; pure pagination checks pass.
REF-008 | PARTIAL | Old killed-sync conclusion superseded: incoming Enabled, outbound Paused. Current persisted import fails pagination (V16). Actual successful durable import and backlog eligibility remain open.
REF-009 | PARTIAL | Old registry kill counts are historical and not authority for current incoming updates. One-way incoming control verified independently; do not unpause all automations. Every worker profile/kill-switch receipt remains separate.
REF-011 | PARTIAL | Sequence count inflation proven with actual SQL fixture (V13). Runtime delivery copy also false under pause (V18). Claimed native missing 39 and true stalled unique-contact count require provider IDs and execution receipts.
REF-012 | PARTIAL | Current consent history is visible. Concrete typed-label defect V17 confirmed. localhost/curl history and each original consent event require exact event/record IDs; unchecked is not a blanket opt-out (focused test passes).
REF-016 | EXPECTED / CONFIGURATION | Daily cap 30 and today sent 0 are current facts; cap is not itself a defect. Global pause retained. SMTP copy is a distinct confirmed defect V18, not proof provider fallback state.
REF-021 | EXPECTED / WORKFLOW OBSERVATION | One pending Delete My Data request visible, dated February 19. That proves a pending workflow item; it does not prove retention/deletion completion. PUT status updates are not execution receipts. No production purge or false completion was performed.
REF-023 | NOT REPRODUCED IN DISPOSABLE CHECK | Actual snapshot/preview/execute route handlers with real admin middleware succeeded for a test-class fixture, durable deletion and idempotent retry. Historical 400 cannot be diagnosed without its original payload. Live browser destructive mutation remains untested; do not mark universally closed.
REF-024 | NOT REPRODUCED IN DISPOSABLE CHECK | Actual archive/restore storage, readback, scoped-list exclusion/reappearance and two audit receipts passed. Historical no-op not reproduced in this component; production browser save/reload remains untested.
REF-027 | CONFIRMED DEFECT | Paused sequence with one step fails FK 23503 using actual storage and current schema; parent persists. V20 is the precise repair; no production sequence was deleted.
REF-030 | NOT REPRODUCED CURRENT UI | Contact More Actions opens the intended menu and stays on the list. Current control is Archive. Earlier Delete-to-detail behavior is not current reproduction; durable archive UI mutation still requires disposable UI coverage.
REF-032 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native GHL is at sign-in; secure authentication did not complete. No password/SSO functional conclusion is possible from the CRM admin session.
REF-033 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native analytics token/capability requires an authenticated GHL session and current native response. CRM connected health probe does not validate this.
REF-035 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native Facebook draft/integration state inaccessible; original draft is historical, not a confirmed current campaign defect.
REF-036 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native Launchpad completion percentage and underlying checklist inaccessible. No current percentage asserted.
REF-037 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Original sample task/opportunity deletion requires exact native object/tombstone/audit receipts. Current local lists cannot establish historical provider deletion.
REF-038 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Duplicate native Go-Live opportunities require current immutable provider IDs and lifecycle lineage; matching names alone are insufficient.
REF-039 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native profile/domain/logo/niche/phone values cannot be read in the signed-out native surface. No configuration change made.
REF-040 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Native agency roles/display-name claims require the native account/user context. Local 28-user list is not equivalent.
REF-042 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | A2P and SHAKEN/STIR registrations require native provider status/receipts. No current registration/delivery conclusion asserted.
REF-045 | PARTIAL | Briefing loads with partial sections and contradictory AI facts (V02/V03); blanket unavailable claim is superseded. Fixture, source and current UI support exact defects, not absence of the entire capability.
REF-047 | UNVERIFIED / LOADING OBSERVATION | Ready for Outreach visited; policy v— and six skeleton rows persisted across observations. No settled eligible total obtained, so this is not a confirmed empty queue or proof pause caused zero. Requires timed response/error evidence and channel-qualified fixtures.
REF-048 | PARTIAL | Merchant Applications now displays 2 records; Approved filter selects and shows 0. Document Vault displays 0 documents with scoped empty guidance. The blanket empty application claim is outdated; protected application/document/MID lifecycle remains Stage 5/6 proof.
REF-049 | PARTIAL | Unread header and page both 3,822; all-notification total 4,906 is expected different scope. Stale deal 1815 link fails to resolve/show unavailable (V19). Historical deletion state and all category counts remain unproved.
REF-050 | CONFIGURATION OBSERVATION | Round Robin Disabled; 0 reps/active/assigned. This proves no configured pool, not engine failure. Actual inbound routing and unassigned-policy receipts must be tested with eligible isolated users.
REF-051 | PARTIAL | Placeholder email earns 25/25 completeness (V10); NBA pause/consent blocks correctly. Last Touch Never and engagement 0 observed for callback, but all activity authorities and score freshness need lineage, not an all-record assertion.
REF-052 | PARTIAL | Scott admin session works; Pending email and 2FA off/warning visible. No universal account or role-security conclusion. Real manager/agent/merchant/partner sessions, deactivation and recovery remain untested.
REF-053 | UPGRADE / COMPOSITE COVERAGE | Route inventory and proposed builder/content/tools/workspace upgrades retained. No blanket functional pass for forms/widgets/calls/BIN/case studies/reviews/partner/merchant workflows. Those actions each need scoped fixtures and protected external effects.
REF-054 | PARTIAL | Training tabs and AI practice open; read-module progress is localStorage, not server certification. Knowledge source list fails despite stats 16 (V21). Approved claims/revision/coaching/certification remain Stage 8.
REF-055 | PARTIAL | Search Liberty QA Test returns two test records. Callback 159443 exists with related deals/tasks. Search failure is not current reproduction; no-workflow assertion needs original event/assignment/SLA receipts and full isolated intake replay.
REF-056 | PARTIAL | Edit opens actual workflow fields; Cancel settles with no dialog or persisted edit. 17 workflows / 455 historical runs render. Source/middleware exposes mutation authorization defect V22. Save/toggle/executor and native workflow ownership are not certified.
REF-057 | HISTORICAL RECEIPTS MISSING | One current sending identity is visible. Exact original removed/reseeded IDs, seed audit/provider verification and retained send references unavailable; no historical completion assertion.
REF-061 | PARTIAL | Null/N/a display prefixes observed in current People records beside meaningful company names. Image-filename email examples not located by exact authoritative IDs. Preserve raw input/provenance; do not mass-overwrite identities from a cosmetic clue.
REF-062 | UNVERIFIED POPULATION INFERENCE | A single/current formulaic score or zero activity does not prove all contacts qualified or 100-row cohort history. Exact original cohort IDs, score input/version and activity joins required.
REF-064 | HISTORICAL RECEIPTS MISSING | Original 33 contact deletions, 4 artifact archives and 18 sequence pauses require object-level before/after IDs and receipts; current counts cannot prove them. No repeat cleanup performed.
REF-065 | NATIVE GHL ACCESS BLOCKED | Original 1,175 native opportunities to zero and restoration require immutable native IDs/tombstones/backups/audit history. Local present counts are not that proof.
REF-067 | HISTORICAL RECEIPTS MISSING | Original ticket identity corrections require specified ticket/contact IDs, prior values, actor and audit receipts; no speculative identity reassignment made.
REF-069 | PARTIAL | Current local population/scope and incoming Enabled observed; import failure V16, explicit-ID stage strategy has all 9 local stages unmapped. Native contacts/workflows/users/forms/phones unavailable. Mapping absence requires approved semantic contracts; numerical parity is not required.

### 13.5 Action coverage and remaining certification boundary

Surface | Actually exercised this pass | Observed result / limit
--- | --- | ---
Home + Tasks | Load overview/briefing; Tasks All scope; compare dates/counts | Current disagreement traced to deletion predicates and AI inputs; no task save/complete/reassign
People + contact workspace | Search known fixture; Add Contact open/close; More Actions; contact Deals/Tasks tabs | Search/dialog/menu/tab destinations work; no persisted production create/archive/restore
GHL settings | Load incoming controls, connection probe evidence, persisted failed-run totals, mapping panel | Incoming enabled/outbound paused; failure explicit; no Apply/Backfill/provider write
Permissions + Queue Holds | Load diagnostics; expand error details | Zero route extraction and map crash reproduced
Lead Ops | Select Provider Results; verify contents; reload | Navigation repaired for tested path; provider actions untouched
Financial hub | Legacy Forecasting URL; select Terminal ROI; read asset rows | Alias wrong, nested tab works, deployment metric semantics wrong
Notifications + Pipeline | Compare unread totals; open one old target link | Counts match same scope; unresolved target has no explanation
Consent + Data Requests | Load audit records and pending request | Typed labels wrong; pending request visible; no privacy purge/status change
Round Robin | Read configuration and current unassigned task/deal examples | Empty rep pool; no eligible role-user routing canary
Sequences | Load report/sending identity; disposable SQL and deletion fixtures | Count inflation and FK deletion failure proved; no live activation/enrollment/send
Workflows + Automation | Edit/cancel; Run History; read proposal hold | Controls open/cancel; 455 historical runs; no save/run/toggle. Mutation guard issue confirmed in middleware fixture
Training + Knowledge | Training/AI practice tabs; Knowledge Add Source/Cancel and stats/list | UI entry points render; knowledge query failure proved; no certification/provider AI call/re-index
Applications + Document Vault | Load application list; Approved filter; load document list | 2 applications, filtered 0 approved, 0 documents; no application eligibility decision, processor/MID or file-access certification
SDR + Ready for Outreach | Load summary; visit ready queue | SDR summary renders; ready queue did not settle in observation window. Not a zero-result pass

The prior 145/146 routes, 309 panel entries and 8,704 control observations remain an **inventory**, not proof every button was clicked and persisted correctly. This pass adds targeted functional and disposable integration proof. No blanket statement that all 95 claims, every route, every mutation, role, viewport, degraded integration or metric has passed is justified. Stages 4–9 retain their provider/lifecycle/security/release responsibilities.

### 13.6 Tests, reproducibility and receipt limits

Focused tests passed: GHL incoming identity/sanitization, capability policy, incoming route guards (42 middleware + 5 input checks), incoming runtime boundary, inbox pagination, consent unchecked-not-opt-out (4 assertions), GHL truth utilities and incoming UI static rendering (10 states). These are bounded checks, not complete provider import or live role certification.

The contact-readiness suite with deliberately unavailable DB produced 23 passes and 10 DB-dependent failures; those failures are an audit-environment limitation, not classified as source regressions. Full stock install failed at the private registry URL. For isolated tests only, dependencies were installed in a separate directory from public npm without the repository lockfile; Node 24.19/npm 11.9 differ from required Node 22/npm 10.9.4. No lockfile or repository source was edited. This environment cannot certify clean stock CI, build, migration or release delivery.

Disposable database: PGlite WASM PostgreSQL/socket, current 376-table Drizzle schema generated as a fixture, plus actual repository migrations 0076, 0198 and 0224 and the exact append-only guard function from 0188. Indexes preceded FK creation to load the snapshot. This is not a full canonical migration replay or native PostgreSQL concurrency suite. No production DB connection was used. Actual storage and handler methods were executed, not reimplementations; middleware checks without a sessionID do not verify durable session validity.

- `verification-lifecycle.log`: archive/filter/restore/audit receipts; test-contact dependency inventory/delete; production-class denial; sequence FK defect.
- `verification-contracts.log`: actual cold-lead handler/guard ownership failure; actual manager enrollment 403; nine workflow guard checks; Knowledge query TypeError; readiness absent-column errors; bulk deletion handler/middleware/idempotency; actual sequence-report join inflation.
- Audit harness files and fixture are retained in the accompanying verification evidence archive; they run only against localhost:55439. Do not use them against production or as release CI.

### 13.7 Roadmap amendments; no extra navigation mega-task

Keep **eight tasks: A, B, C1–C5, D**, and the 11-destination proposal and Liberty token/layout specification in Sections 5–10. New evidence changes repair contents and acceptance, not the safe delivery boundaries.

Task | Current amendments and acceptance dependency
--- | ---
A | Bind the accessible exact serving source; portable lockfile/stock CI; fix incoming pagination and prove local-only reconciliation while incoming stays enabled/outbound paused; actor/scope/metric contracts; restrict shared workflow mutations before any run
B | Canonical task and briefing inputs; selected-ID authorization; governed sequence archive/delete with dependencies; resolve notification targets; supported knowledge list query; typed consent authority; safe lifecycle handlers and disposable UI fixtures
C1 | Typed route/query registry preserves parent tab and aliases; shared Liberty shell/tokens and reusable loading/error/empty patterns; do not repeat Provider Results repair
C2 | Rep record and task workspace, same-scope cards, readiness permission reasons and stale notification unavailable state; protected create/edit/archive/restore browser tests
C3 | Sales engagement workspace, independent sequence counts, role-scoped enrollment reads, runtime pause/provider truth, explicit deletion blocking and inbox partial-state clarity
C4 | Lifecycle/financial groups, corrected financial aliases, recommendation versus deployment/payback semantics; retain protected Stage 5/6 fixtures
C5 | Admin/Lead Ops/resources grouping, Express 5 permissions, Queue Holds DTO, operator parent-tab preservation, knowledge error/retry, consent labels and diagnostic freshness
D | Actual serving release end-to-end role/mutation/no-send/degraded/mobile/metric reconciliation after task checks. Native GHL and historical cleanup receipts remain explicit required evidence, not silent passes

Do not repeat already implemented GHL separation or Provider Results navigation. Do not use these audit tests as certification of the final UI design. Stage 3 remains **OPEN / NOT CERTIFIED** until required real-session, durable UI and integration receipts exist. Update this report and the ledger after every implemented task and audit.


## 14. Task A/B master prompt authoring audit — 2026-10-02

This addendum is authoritative for serving-source provenance at prompt authoring time and A/B implementation ownership. It preserves all 95 source entries,14 repair groups,22 previously traced repair causes and the C1–C5 split. No repairs were implemented or deployed by this authoring audit.

Fresh GitHub clone/main remains `74c15805a5cbdb3e0a82183c8c56104999075671`. Current public health reports status ok, SHA `1fe28bc0d1ff9ad86e777c96b67902701f159fd8`, builtAt `2026-10-02T21:40:33.861Z`, publishBuildId `a17e3a59-81fe-4ad6-80ab-0b2b27b8ec61`, env production and ghlTransportFailFast false. Fetching the reported SHA from origin fails `not our ref`. Section13.1's source-equivalence/CRM3-01 superseded conclusion applies to the earlier 4cd62b serving build only; current serving-source equivalence is unverified again. This is a provenance finding, not evidence the current app is broken or permission for Stage9 freeze. Task A obtains the current Replit source/build receipt; independent reviewed source fixes proceed with explicit source-only limits.

Fresh source reinspection still traces internal private lockfile URLs, cold-lead ownership gap, shared workflow create/update/run isAuthenticated-only guards, independent task query predicates that omit soft deletes, omitted overdueTaskCount AI input, sequence step×enrollment join, unsupported cold-lead value multiplier, terminal recommendations counted as deployed, consent non-opt-in→OptOut rendering, direct sequence parent deletion with FK children and unsupported Knowledge list db.execute({sql,params}). Existing revenue/task/contactability/consent authorities, guarded contact lifecycle, rep provisioning/session invalidation and one-way incoming sync are reuse targets. Current incoming pagination validator is source reviewed; original failed provider metadata was not obtained, so numeric nextPage is not certified as the exact live failure cause.

This pass inspected current source, CI/manifest/test-infrastructure guards, actual handler registrations and public health/source provenance. It did not rerun stock dependency install/full CI, canonical PostgreSQL migrations, provider transport, production browser actions or previous disposable fixture tests. Section13 live/component outcomes remain dated receipts. No new count of fully verified source entries is asserted; no original partial/native/historical claim is promoted merely by re-reading code. Current control state was not independently re-observed from authenticated UI in this pass; required user policy remains outboundPaused and incomingEnabled.

Two ready-to-send preflight+build prompts created: `LIBERTY_STAGE3_TASK_A_PREFLIGHT_BUILD_MASTER_PROMPT.md` and `LIBERTY_STAGE3_TASK_B_PREFLIGHT_BUILD_MASTER_PROMPT.md`. Each includes seeded verified-from-current-code table, all assigned original source IDs with prior qualifications, precise implementation scope/steps/files, kill lines, rg checks, meaningful registered-route/DB/session/browser fixtures, stock CI and final evidence/report update gates. Partial/unverified claims are tasks within preflight, not omitted or generic postponements. Real external evidence gaps retain exact later owners; safe local work does not wait on native history.

| Overlap | Exact single implementation owner |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical task predicate/status/metric DTO | A; B consumes it for Tasks/Home/briefing and actions. |
| Sequence distinct aggregation and manager authorized read/runtime truth | A; B owns recoverable archive/delete/cancel dependencies and UI actions; C3 full design. |
| Cold-lead collection/per-ID and shared workflow mutation/run auth | A; B applies same authority to workflow/relationship consumers. |
| GHL pagination/no-echo/import and manual-create response/replay contract | A; B proves intake/routing/SLA and UI consumers. |
| Consent labels/request workflow, readiness, inbox drafts, notifications, user lifecycle, Knowledge SQL/error | B; C2/C5 later layout; D native/historical; Stages8/9 certification. |
| Financial scope/scenario/deployment/actual semantics | A; C4 layout, Stage6 actual processor/residual-ledger proof. |

Run A before coupled B integration. Nondependent B work can proceed. Prompts authorize reviewable repository changes, not production deployment/provider purchases/sends/enrollment/purge. Incoming sync stays independently enabled and must not be disabled because outbound is paused. Minimal working UI/labels/actions are in A/B; full 11-destination grouping/token/layout rollout remains C1–C5. Implementation status: NOT STARTED by this authoring turn; Stage 3 remains uncertified. Update this same specification and go-live ledger after each actual task/audit.


## 15. Task #2061 current-repo/original-report audit — 2026-10-03

**Current decision:** retain Task #2061 / Task A and apply the five focused amendments in `LIBERTY_TASK_2061_REPO_AND_ORIGINAL_AUDIT_REVIEW.md`, then build. No new task sequence or C navigation mega-task. This section supersedes older serving-source provenance assertions for the current observed build; original findings/evidence remain preserved and qualified. No Task A implementation, repair, merge or deployment performed by this review.

Fresh fetched GitHub main is `7fd447ada822cdd363d567e78f29b3a976714d05`. Public health reports serving `c893360a439dbbc829a3bb6b66a11453fc41315d`, builtAt `2026-10-03T11:27:47.302Z`, publishBuildId `6302bdac-3bd2-42be-bc7d-15008e9ed986`, status ok, production, ghlTransportFailFast false. Both accessible commits share tree `35a913ebfb017501a996da7c50aed257f1b8c0ce`; tracked diff empty. The prior inaccessible source gap is superseded for this observation. Deployed artifact/build/install receipts remain separate; no serving-source release certification inferred from health/git trees.

The attached preflight correctly retains all 33 parent rows from the original A prompt register (zero missing parent IDs), explicitly includes REF-056/V22, preserves B/C/D/later-stage boundaries, corrects single numeric agent-path scope via global middleware, treats task-authority as creation-only and retains the newer pure inbound parser. This is not 33 unique defects or a new 95-entry disposition recount. Replit claimed clean install/SRI receipts remain supplied evidence; they were not independently reproduced here.

Current actual strict real-lock policy execution returns exit 1 with 4 PRIVATE_PACKAGE_HOST + 4 NON_HTTPS_TARBALL errors (two policy violations per resolution, not 8 CRM defects). Pure pagination/source assertions pass in a scratch import/base-URL adaptation; existing repo source/test unchanged. A loopback-only default fetch fixture follows a 302 redirect to another path, proving transport behavior only. Audit environment Node 24/npm 11 differs from declared supported Node 22.22.0/npm 10.9.4; no full stock CI, canonical DB/Redis/session/browser action certification is claimed. No DB mutation/provider activity/control toggle or production fixture was performed.

| Amendment | Exact implementation / gate owner |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical documents | Supply this updated report and current ledger to Replit; remove avoidable missing-document limitation. Preserve original 95 IDs and final outcomes for each A-owned subclaim, not blanket closure. |
| Task backend adoption | A implements and adopts shared read/metric authority in applicable storage/tasks, analytics and daily-briefing backend queries; B owns client/UI/workflow and AI factual input/fallback. No unused helper or competing query copies; full CRM3-05 remains pending B gates. |
| Sequence runtime truth | A minimal runtime DTO/consumer repair explicitly includes SequenceReport hardcoded compliance-pause and SMTP-not-configured/all-through-GHL assertions; C3 design later. Typed observed/configured/paused/unknown/error fixtures, no test sends. Existing V18/CRM3-04/REF-011/016 scope, no extra defect count. |
| Cold re-engagement outcome truth | A cold-action authority repair includes false/replit_direct results incorrectly counted enrolled at contacts.ts:1237 and processed-vs-performed distinction for single response. Pause/action authority before activation-like tags/effects; actual handler false/blocked/mixed-ID/retry fixtures with zero live enrollment/native write. Existing V11/CRM3-14 scope. |
| GHL redirect boundary | A existing incoming service fetch rejects unvalidated redirects; fake-service 302/307/host/path/scope/timeout/retry tests prove no destination request or premature apply. Preserve parser/no-echo/incoming Enabled; no claim of actual attack/token leak/historical pagination cause. |

Keep outbound Paused, incoming independently Enabled and proposals Hold for Review as required policy; authenticated runtime controls were not newly observed. Exact task review/addendum contains source evidence, gate commands and copy-paste Replit instructions. A scope is aligned; apply amendments and execute existing CI/DB/session/browser gates. No additional unique repair-group total or fully verified-source-entry count is asserted. Update same report and ledger after implementation, separating source-fixed/tested/merged/deployed/live-verified. Stages 1–2 remain recorded complete; Stage 3 remains open; C1–C5/D and later-lane obligations unchanged.

## Stage 3 A intermediate implementation dispositions — 2026-10-03

**INCOMPLETE; NOT MERGED, DEPLOYED OR LIVE-VERIFIED.** These are workspace source
changes and bounded component certifications. No parent/composite finding is
closed. All original 95 IDs, historical allegations, rejected inferences and
B/C/D/later-stage owners above remain unchanged. The 33 original A parent rows
below are not 33 unique defects. Amendment subclaims follow separately.

Exact commands, scope, symbols, changed paths and gate limits:
`.local/tasks/liberty-stage3-task-a-execution-receipts.md`. Passing typecheck,
build, portable-lock policy, supported stock install and focused fixtures do not
replace missing stock CI, exhaustive handler/DB/browser gates or native history.
Security audit currently rejects **seven high** Tailwind-chain findings; all
published braces versions through public latest 3.0.3 are affected by
GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm. No major package migration, automatic typography downgrade,
exception or audit-policy weakening was authorized. Stock static CI separately
previously failed the baseline SFP `assertPaidBudgetAuthorized` assertion. The user
confirmed paid approval and paid limits were intentionally removed. The stale
expectation now checks their absence while retaining activation/reservation/dispatch
checks; the focused source suite passes all 21 assertions. No runtime paid gate or
limit was restored. Full stock CI has not been recertified. Stage 3 stays open.

| Original A parent | Individual A slice outcome / actual proof | Remaining owner / qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM3-01 | Source/manifest/lock recorded at dirty workspace HEAD 1c6f81a; local build succeeds. Prior c85deb3c serving receipt predates repair. | A clean final candidate; D/platform repaired serving artifact/install/live receipt. No source-to-deployment equivalence. |
| CRM3-02 | Public npm regeneration preserves package identities; supported scripts-enabled stock install PASS; real-lock strict policy and policy/inventory fixtures PASS. Security FAIL; stale paid-approval SFP expectation corrected with focused 21-assertion PASS. Complete stock jobs remain uncertified. | A blocked dependency remediation and both full stock jobs. Historic 502 not reproduced. |
| CRM3-03 | Existing parser/no-echo preserved; guarded actual service multi-page/apply/epoch/lease/webhook/replay PASS; redirect boundary tested. Local-create degraded/replay source repaired only. | A timeout/429/retry and create fault/concurrency matrix; B consumers; D historic/native/fleet. |
| CRM3-04 | Typed runtime DTO separates configured/global pause from unobserved enablement/probe/delivery. 27 static-render permutations plus unavailable read PASS; no compliance/SMTP literal assertions. | A interacting signed-in UI/fleet evidence mapping; D current native/worker observations. Configuration is not health. |
| CRM3-05 | Parameterized task read/state/metric contract actually adopted in storage/routes/overview/report/briefing.

Actual sessions, mixed-ID denial, CSRF and retry PASS. | A stale-owner/state races, all action predicates and false-bridge/true-receipt fixture matrix; B lifecycle; Stage 9 broader security. Numeric guard preserved. |
| CRM3-15 | Unsupported audience dollars removed in route/UI; handler fixture proves no estimatedValue. Dormant census is not consent/readiness. | A full browser/label receipt; C2/C4 design. No source-based revenue or invalidity inference. |
| CRM3-16 | Independent child aggregates; actual DB 2 steps/3 historical memberships/1 unique contact PASS. Paused active memberships no longer automatically stalled/delivered. | A zero children and manager/browser gates; B archive/cancel; C3; D native historical membership receipts. |
| CRM3-17 | Owned manager enrollment endpoint/client replaces forbidden global dependency; loading/error counts explicit, including per-card counts. | A owned-manager positive/global-denied/session/browser/API-failure certification; B lifecycle. Global restriction retained. |
| CRM3-20 | Stored incoming lease/checkpoint/update observation is typed and separate from queue/worker proof. Missing observation is unavailable/not observed. | A exact owner-source coverage and interacting UI; D/Stage 4 current enrichment runtime receipts. No jobs enabled. |
| CRM3-23 | No provisioning/invitation/deactivation feature added or certified under A. | B lifecycle/discoverability; C5; Stage 9. Prior capability finding retained. |
| CRM3-25 | Focused workflow management/role/identifier denial gates PASS with actual sessions and zero workflow runs/provider fetches on denial. No overall readiness verdict. | A remaining positive/executor-race cases; B Knowledge; C5/D/Stages 8–9. |
| REF-003 | Stable committed contact 202 degraded receipt and canonical incomplete replay source changes; accepted/completed replay remains no-op. | A full linkage/task/effect/audit/queue/timeout/concurrent fault fixtures; B work UI; D original production request/contact/error receipt. Not closed by dedupe. |
| REF-006 | Existing class/archive/relationship distinctions retained; task predicate adoption and focused fixtures do not reproduce historic 2-vs-3 pipeline. | A full object/deal metric parity; C2/C4; D immutable same-scope linked IDs. |
| REF-008 | Independent incoming lane preserved; actual fake-GET service certification PASS; default HTTP redirects rejected. | A timeout/429/retry cases; D original pagination metadata/backlog/approved stage semantics. Numeric nextPage not proved historic cause. |
| REF-009 | No worker activation; configured/paused/stored checkpoint labels do not claim 12/20 active workers. | A remaining owner diagnostics; D/Stage 4 actual ownership/heartbeat/checkpoint receipts. Historical counts remain dated. |
| REF-011 | Fanout and runtime assertions source repaired; DB independent memberships and static runtime permutations PASS. | A zero/manager/browser cases; B lifecycle; C3; D native 39/stalled identities and delivery. Under pause, active is not permission. |
| REF-014 | No paid OpenAI/model/index request; runtime report does not claim verified consumption. | B Knowledge; D current observations; Stage 8 model/index evidence. Prior configured/405 facts remain qualified. |
| REF-015 | Disposable Redis exists only for test infrastructure, not production worker proof. Incoming checkpoint/lease DTO does not claim queue health. | A remaining runtime map; D production Redis/worker receipts. Connected is not consumed. |
| REF-017 | Incoming/manual/webhook observation separated; no invented native workflow IDs or mapping. | A remaining explicit owner classes; D/Stage 4 approved native dependency inventory. No blanket 39-workflow requirement. |
| REF-018 | Production predicates/synthetic-QA exclusions preserved; focused actor/data fixtures only. No production cleanup/census. | A exhaustive class/archive fixtures; B users; D historical/live counts. No purge authority. |
| REF-020 | Prior disproved “no Invite” allegation retained; no invitation sent. | B discoverability/lifecycle; C5/Stage 9 certification. |
| REF-029 | Membership and unique-contact counters separated; paused/terminal meaning clarified. No stalled cleanup performed. | A remaining counter fixtures; B governed cleanup; Stage 4. Upgrade not new defect. |
| REF-041 | No external/local stage count parity or mapping guessed. Incoming observation is not approved semantic mapping. | D native IDs/semantic approval and Stage 4; A unmapped-label browser proof pending. |
| REF-046 | No reliance on old 6,471 inventory or superseded screenshot as current denominator. Scoped source repairs only. | A full object/event metric labels; C2/C4 workspace; D current-view receipt. |
| REF-052 | Six actual local-password role sessions and changed route/CSRF denial matrix PASS; not universal auth/2FA/deactivation proof. | A full registered server/browser gate coverage; B lifecycle; Stage 9. |
| REF-059 | Rejected appearance/plausibility→83% validity inference retained; no rows deleted or reclassified. | Stage 5/8 actual evidence; no A defect manufactured. |
| REF-060 | QQ/numeric-address invalidity inference rejected and retained. | Validation authority only; no appearance-based purge. |
| REF-061 | No immutable historic email/name examples obtained; raw identity preserved. | D exact IDs/history; B/C2 separately owned display work. |
| REF-066 | Actual DB proves memberships versus unique contacts and fanout correction, not old 2,094/2,097/~2,040 native census. | A remaining counter matrix; B later lifecycle; D original immutable history. |
| REF-069 | Local no-echo/identity/preservation service fixtures PASS; no native contacts/stages/users/forms/phone comparison or mapping performed. | A remaining runtime/pagination cases; D native semantic inventory/Stage 4. No forced numerical parity. |

Assigned amendment subclaims: REF-016/V18 receives typed SMTP/global-pause/
unknown/error static-render proof, not delivery/cap change (A interacting UI;
D/Stage 4 delivery; C3 design remain). REF-056/V22 receives actual session
workflow denial/input/zero-run proof, not all positive executor/security cases
(A remaining fixtures; B editor; Stage 9). REF-037/038/065 and REF-064/067 retain
D immutable deletion/restore/actor/timestamp/before-after history obligations;
none is closed by new component fixtures. No additional defect total is asserted.

## Latest Task A evidence update — 2026-10-03

**INCOMPLETE / NOT READY FOR REVIEW OR RELEASE.** This update supersedes the
intermediate A dispositions above, not the 95 original findings or their dated
evidence. No merge, deployment, production DDL, provider spend/send/enrollment,
native write, held-work release or proposal approval is asserted.

Proof references below are receipts, not additional finding IDs:
**HTTP** = real session/CSRF/DB cold/workflow handlers and contact/related-deal
ownership lock races; **TASK** = shared storage/list/overview/analytics/briefing
same-clock static-fixture comparisons plus class/archive/link/date rules;
**SEQ** = independent DB child/zero/historical/manager/error cases;
**FIN** = full-population 5,001-row forecast/unknown-actual/missing-cost cases;
**CREATE** = registered writer/request fault/replay/concurrency fixtures;
**GET** = actual fake-service incoming pagination/redirect/timeout/429/checkpoint/
lease/epoch/webhook/no-echo fixtures; **UI** = 27 typed runtime render permutations,
unavailable read, and real signed-in desktop plus phone viewport in existing
desktop-view mode. Native mobile work queues are not certified.

proof, not cap enforcement or verified delivery (D/Stage 4/C3 remain).
REF-056/V22 has HTTP role/entity/denied-run proof, not universal executor/editor/
security closure (B/Stage 9 remain). REF-037/038/065 and REF-064/067 retain their
D deletion/restore/actor/time/before-after history obligations. All composite
parents with outstanding B/C/D/later-stage claims remain PARTIAL.

### Final scoped A handoff correction — 2026-10-03

Implementation and focused certification are complete at the user's confirmed
scope; broader legacy test repairs stopped. **NOT RELEASE-READY:** full stock
integration/server jobs still fail. No deployment/live/native/Stage 3 closure is
asserted. Original findings and all 95 IDs remain intact. The following individually
supersedes outdated cells in the 33-parent matrix above; every other row and its
B/C/D/later-stage qualification remains in force.

| Original A parent | Final A outcome / receipt | Remaining owner or qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM3-01 | Implementation committed at 255d25bbbf6d014ed34a18ca5e46aae0be1278df; isolated typecheck/build/inventory/redacting scan PASS. | D/platform repaired serving/install/live proof; full CI remains blocked, not release-ready. |
| CRM3-02 | Supported public install, strict real-lock policy (939 fingerprints), API census, security (zero high/critical; 7 moderate/1 low), static 57/57 and writable-build 1/1 PASS. | Full integration stops at CR-06 Redis reservation; server stops at New-Lead Enrollment Policy B9/B22/B23. No full-CI or baseline-equivalence claim. |
| CRM3-11 | Same-clock shared scalar comparisons plus actual session list/facet/cache/export population parity PASS; owned/unassigned scope preserved. | C2/C4 presentation; D immutable native census. |
| CRM3-17 | Owned manager positive/global-and-other-owner denial PASS; signed-in read-error is unavailable, not zero. | B lifecycle; comprehensive work-queue UI remains outside this handoff. |
| CRM3-20 | Incoming facts rendered separately from explicit unavailable legacy GHL/enrichment/SLA/communications owners and native mapping; 27 permutations plus unavailable-read PASS. | D/Stage 4 exact current fleet observations; stored run facts are not worker consumption. |
| REF-006 | TASK/scalar and actual session list/facet/cache/export parity PASS; different populations explicitly separate. | D native same-scope linked IDs. |
| REF-015 | Runtime owner classes explicitly unavailable where unobserved; render PASS. Disposable Redis is not production queue-health evidence. | D production Redis/worker observations. |
| REF-017 | Manual incoming/webhook facts distinct; native mapping and legacy owner observations explicitly unavailable, not guessed. | D/Stage 4 approved native inventory. |
| REF-041 | Explicit unavailable native-mapping proof in diagnostic UI; no numerical/semantic stage equivalence inferred. | D approved native IDs/semantics; Stage 4. |
| REF-046 | Scoped scalar/list/facet/export/cache populations tested; record censuses remain distinct from performed-action/event claims. | C2/C4 workspace; D current live-view receipt. |
| REF-052 | Focused real role sessions/CSRF/denial and signed-in reporting browser proof PASS; stock server-required job FAILED separately. | B lifecycle; Stage 9 universal auth/2FA/deactivation; full-CI release blocker. |

Exact commands, logs, exported contracts and changed-path handoff:
`.local/tasks/liberty-stage3-task-a-execution-receipts.md`, final scoped section
and its `stage3-a-final/handoff-*` receipts. This correction closes A implementation
slices only, not composite parents, native/history obligations or release gates.
Outbound remains Paused, incoming independently Enabled, proposals Hold for Review.
