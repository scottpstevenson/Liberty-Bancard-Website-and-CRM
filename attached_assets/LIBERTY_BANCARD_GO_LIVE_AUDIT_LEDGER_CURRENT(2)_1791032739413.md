# LIBERTY BANCARD — GO-LIVE AUDIT LEDGER (CURRENT)

**Canonical working record for the fresh Liberty Bancard go-live audit**

**Latest audit:** Section 18 records the October 2 Stage 3 three-audit consolidation, fresh authenticated checks, current source/runtime identities, proposed navigation/design/metric contracts and grouped implementation roadmap. Section 17 and earlier sections remain historical evidence.  
**Created:** 2026-09-28  
**Purpose:** Preserve every material audit finding, closure state, evidence gap, and coverage decision so findings are never lost in chat history or overwritten by later reports.

---

## 1. Operating Rules

This ledger is **append-only in substance**.

- Never delete a finding because it was fixed.
- Never overwrite discovery evidence with later closure evidence.
- Move findings through explicit states instead:
  - `OPEN`
  - `FIX IN PROGRESS`
  - `MERGED`
  - `DEPLOYED`
  - `RUNTIME VERIFIED`
  - `CLOSED`
- If code is fixed but production/runtime has not been independently verified, do **not** mark the finding `CLOSED`.
- If an area has not been exercised, mark it `UNTESTED` or `NOT STARTED`; never call it `PASS` merely because no defect is known.
- Every audit session must record the Git SHA reviewed.
- Final certification must bind to one exact deployed SHA only after remediation/build work is finished.
- Security review is continuous, but final **Platform / Security / Release Certification** occurs near the end of the go-live program.

### Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P0` | Immediate launch stop / active data, auth, send, spend, destructive, or severe security risk |
| `P1` | Must be corrected before go-live; material security, reliability, business-flow, data, release, or compliance defect |
| `P2` | Important operational/UX/control defect; can be scheduled behind P0/P1 if safely bounded |
| `P3` | Improvement / polish / low-risk cleanup |
| `EVIDENCE` | Not necessarily a product defect, but proof is missing and certification cannot close without it |

---

## 2. Last Independently Audited Baseline

| Item | Current Evidence |
|---|---|
| Repository | `scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM` |
| Default branch | `main` |
| Current audited `main` SHA | `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` |
| Current `main` commit title | `Published your App` |
| Migration journal | 317 entries |
| Current migration journal head | `0312_contact_business_system_links` |
| Latest GitHub commit explicitly titled `Published your App` observed during audit | `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` |
| Current `main` vs that publish-marked commit | Same GitHub commit |
| Exact currently deployed runtime SHA | **UNVERIFIED FROM GITHUB ALONE** |
| Final release SHA frozen? | **NO — intentionally deferred** |
| Replit contacted during this audit? | **NO** |
| Production mutated during this audit? | **NO** |

### Important baseline rule

The commit titled `Published your App` is useful historical evidence, but it is **not by itself proof of the exact SHA currently serving production**. Final runtime identity remains an evidence requirement.

## 3. Open Findings — Current Fresh Audit

### SEC-01 — Internal deal proposal read route is reachable by authenticated merchant sessions

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Security / CRM authorization |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — present in current publish-marked head; authenticated runtime role verification pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8c88fd13126e8a87efbbb728a59a6a68e348a186` |
| Primary path | `GET /api/deals/:id/proposal` |
| Primary file | `server/routes/ai.ts` |
| Related authority | `server/services/crm-object-access.ts`; `server/replit_integrations/auth/replitAuth.ts`; `server/routes.ts` |

**Finding**  
`GET /api/deals/:id/proposal` currently uses `isAuthenticated`, not `isDashboardUser` or another merchant-safe object authorization contract.

The global `crmObjectAccessGuard` scopes direct deal/contact paths only when `req.user.role === "agent"`. The partner middleware separately blocks partner sessions from general CRM routes. An authenticated `merchant` is therefore not rejected by either of those global guards before the proposal handler reads the deal/proposal.

**Why it matters**  
An authenticated merchant account should not be able to enumerate/read arbitrary internal CRM deal proposal data merely by possessing or guessing a deal ID.

**Required correction**

- Classify the intended audience for the internal deal-proposal endpoint.
- Apply the appropriate dashboard/object-level authorization boundary.
- Do not break the separate public bearer-token proposal journey.
- Add negative tests for merchant, partner, unrelated agent, and anonymous access.
- Preserve admin/manager and correctly owned agent behavior where intended.

**Closure evidence required**

- Merged SHA.
- Route guard/object-policy test.
- Deployed SHA.
- Authenticated runtime verification across relevant roles.

### SEC-02 — Session revocation / expiry authority fails open when validation lookup errors

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Security / Authentication |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — present in current publish-marked head; runtime failure-injection verification pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8c88fd13126e8a87efbbb728a59a6a68e348a186` |
| Primary file | `server/replit_integrations/auth/replitAuth.ts` |
| Primary function | `checkSessionValidity()` |

**Finding**  
When the backing `user_sessions` validity lookup throws, the catch path logs `session_validation_failed` and returns `null`. `null` is then interpreted by `isAuthenticated`, `isDashboardUser`, `isAdmin`, and other role guards as “no invalid reason,” allowing the already-authenticated request to continue.

The code explicitly states: `On error, allow through (fail open to avoid breaking the app)`.

**What this does NOT mean**  
This is not an anonymous login bypass. Passport must still consider the request authenticated.

**Actual risk**  
If a session should have been rejected because it was revoked, idle-expired, absolutely expired, or administratively terminated, a failure of the session-validity backing lookup can prevent that revocation/expiry decision from being enforced for that request.

**Required correction**

- Fail closed for protected CRM/dashboard/admin routes when session validity cannot be authoritatively checked.
- Use an explicit error result such as `session_validation_unavailable` rather than returning the same value as “valid.”
- Choose an appropriate response (`401`, `503`, or controlled equivalent) without silently permitting the request.
- Add tests for backing-store failure across `isAuthenticated`, `isDashboardUser`, `isAdmin`, and other security-sensitive guards.

**Closure evidence required**

- Unit/integration failure-injection tests.
- No anonymous regression.
- No merchant/partner/dashboard role regression.
- Runtime verification after deployment.

### REL-01 — GitHub CI cannot execute cleanly because lockfile contains Replit-internal package URLs

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Release / CI |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `CLOSED — clean GitHub-hosted runner install now succeeds; current CI is red for a different SFP regression` |
| Discovered / reconfirmed at SHA | `8c88fd13126e8a87efbbb728a59a6a68e348a186` |
| Current GitHub Actions run inspected | CI run `#314` / run id `36460401002` |
| Primary file | `package-lock.json` |
| Historical related program | Repository exposure / dependency-lockfile portability work (`RVR-02`) |

**Finding**  
The current GitHub Actions run fails at `npm ci` before any security/build/integration suites execute. The lockfile contains package tarball URLs pointing at `http://package-firewall.replit.internal/...`, which a GitHub-hosted runner cannot resolve.

At the audited SHA, six occurrences of the Replit-internal package host were present in `package-lock.json`, including PostgreSQL dependency packages.

**Observed CI consequence**

- Dependency installation: `FAIL`
- Deterministic static suites: `SKIPPED`
- External dependency/security audit: `SKIPPED`
- Release artifact build/scan: `SKIPPED`
- Integration job: `SKIPPED`

The failure is therefore **not evidence that application tests failed**; it is evidence that the independent CI gate cannot run.

**Why it matters**  
A release cannot be independently certified on GitHub if a clean runner cannot install the locked dependency graph.

**Required correction**

- Regenerate/normalize the lockfile so resolved package URLs are portable from standard clean CI runners.
- Preserve dependency versions/integrity rather than silently changing the dependency graph.
- Add a portability check preventing reintroduction of `*.replit.internal` package resolution URLs.
- Re-run static, external-security, build-scan, migration, and integration jobs successfully.

**Closure evidence required**

- Clean-runner `npm ci` success.
- Full current-head GitHub CI completion.
- Artifact/security/integration stages actually executed, not skipped.

### REL-02 — Pre-deploy wrapper claims provider denial without establishing a global provider-deny boundary for the server process

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Release / Certification Safety |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — outer pre-deploy zero-egress boundary is present; full certification-run proof pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8c88fd13126e8a87efbbb728a59a6a68e348a186` |
| Primary files | `scripts/run-pre-deploy.sh`; `scripts/pre-deploy.ts`; provider-deny helpers |

**Finding**  
`scripts/run-pre-deploy.sh` says it starts the dev server “with provider denial,” but the wrapper launches the server with `GHL_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST=true` and does not itself establish `VG_PROVIDER_DENY_MODE=1` for the server process.

Many individual certification suites correctly install disposable/provider-deny boundaries. The background server, however, inherits the surrounding process environment and selected worker topology unless otherwise fenced.

**Why it matters**  
A ceremony that states “This gate makes NO real provider calls” should establish that property at the outermost process boundary, not rely on every individual worker/service/test path to remain independently safe.

**Required correction**

- Make zero-egress/provider-deny behavior explicit at the wrapper/server boundary for certification runs.
- Ensure background workers/schedulers cannot make live provider calls during certification.
- Preserve GHL fail-fast isolation.
- Add an executable assertion proving provider denial is active before server-required suites begin.

**Closure evidence required**

- Certification process-env test.
- Fake/denied provider assertion.
- Successful complete pre-deploy run with zero external provider effects.

---

### ADS-01 — Offline conversion export is accessible to ordinary dashboard agents

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Ads / Attribution / CRM Authorization |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — admin/manager restriction present; runtime role verification pending` |
| Discovered / reconfirmed at SHA | `8c88fd13126e8a87efbbb728a59a6a68e348a186` |
| Endpoint | `GET /api/acquisition/offline-conversions/export` |
| Primary file | `server/routes/acquisition.ts` |

**Finding**  
The offline-conversion export uses `isDashboardUser`, which permits `admin`, `manager`, and `agent`. The export includes conversion data suitable for Google Ads import and reads contact identifiers including email and GCLID.

**Why it matters**  
Bulk ad-attribution/conversion export is an administrative/growth-operations function and exposes data beyond what ordinary sales agents need for daily CRM work.

**Required correction**

- Restrict the bulk export to the approved administrative roles (expected: admin/manager unless a narrower governed role is established).
- Keep ordinary read-only acquisition metrics separately scoped if agents legitimately need them.
- Add role-matrix coverage for export vs non-export acquisition endpoints.

**Closure evidence required**

- Route-role tests.
- Runtime role verification.

---

### REL-03 — Exact deployed runtime SHA is not yet independently proven

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Release Identity |
| Severity | `EVIDENCE` |
| Status | `OPEN — GitHub head is publish-marked, but exact serving runtime identity remains unverified` |
| Current main | `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` |
| Latest publish-marked commit observed in GitHub | `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` |
| Distance | Same GitHub commit; exact serving runtime SHA still requires runtime identity evidence |

**Finding / evidence gap**  
GitHub proves the repository state and commit history but does not by itself prove the exact SHA currently serving `libertybancard.com` / the production CRM.

The four commits after the latest publish-marked commit include changes to:

- the selected background-worker profile;
- continuous SFP discovery/validation;
- SFP provider operations;
- runtime attestation refresh.

**Why it matters**  
Live/runtime audit findings must be attributed to the code actually serving traffic, not assumed from `main`.

**Required evidence**

- Production health/release identity exposing exact deployed SHA.
- Migration head.
- worker/profile identity.
- confirmation of whether current `main` changes are deployed before relying on them as runtime truth.

**Closure rule**  
Do not close until exact deployed runtime identity is independently verified. This is intentionally deferred until runtime/browser audit stages and final release certification.

## 4. Historical Findings Revalidated During This Fresh Audit

These rows remain in the ledger permanently. Their current status reflects only what the fresh source audit proved.

### ENR-H01 — Task #2002 `sunbiz-full-backfill` selective worker-profile omission

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Prospecting / Enrichment / Workers |
| Severity when found | `P1` |
| Current status | `MERGED` — runtime closure not yet independently verified |
| Original defect | `sunbiz-full-backfill` existed but was not assigned to any selectable capability group, so a selective deployment could mark backfill running without a consuming worker. |
| Current code evidence | Dedicated `sunbiz-backfill` capability group now maps to `sunbiz-full-backfill`. Checked-in selective profile includes `sunbiz-backfill`. |

**Do not delete this row.**  
Final closure still requires runtime proof that the deployed profile actually instantiates the queue/worker and the cursor advances safely.

---

### ENR-H02 — SFP `ready_held` campaign-staging intent had no governed paused-enrollment consumer

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Prospecting / Campaigns / Enrollment |
| Severity when found | `P1` |
| Current status | `MERGED` — runtime closure not yet independently verified |
| Current code | `server/services/cro03/sfp-enrollment-bridge.ts`; admin bridge route in `server/routes/lead-ops.ts` |

**Current source evidence**

The bridge now:

- converts a governed `ready_held` intent into a **paused** sequence enrollment;
- does not activate/send;
- refuses synthetic placeholder email creation;
- checks real/corroborated identity;
- rechecks promotion/suppression/existing-customer eligibility;
- rejects conflict with an already active enrollment;
- uses locking/idempotency protections;
- carries dedicated disposable certification coverage.

**Remaining closure proof**

- exact deployed SHA;
- real runtime canary with isolated test/canary records;
- prove zero unauthorized send;
- prove pause/hold state in UI and data.

---

### SEC-H01 — September AI/CRM authorization regression

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Security / AI CRM |
| Original status | P0/P1 authorization concern |
| Current status | `PARTIALLY CLOSED` |

**Fresh source evidence now confirms**

- company-wide AI insight/task/onboarding scans are admin/manager constrained;
- dashboard AI actions use `isDashboardUser` where appropriate;
- body-supplied contact/deal/ticket IDs have explicit ownership checks in audited paths;
- proposal bearer tokens are fingerprinted before audit logging;
- public proposal token routes have rate limiting;
- stale `sales` role checks were changed to the actual `agent` role in proposal-related mutations;
- chargeback copilot paths now check linked deal/contact access.

**Still open from this family**

- `SEC-01` internal proposal read route remains only `isAuthenticated`.

Therefore the historical family cannot yet be marked fully `CLOSED`.

---

## 5. Latent / Configuration Risk Register

These are not all proven active production defects, but they are important conditions that can become dangerous if topology or release configuration changes.

### CFG-01 — Legacy outreach/orchestrator flags remain armed in checked-in Replit configuration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Runtime / Outreach Safety |
| Severity | `P2` |
| Status | `MERGED — checked-in legacy flags now safe-off; deployed runtime environment verification pending` |
| Observed values at current source | `LEGACY_OUTREACH_ENABLED=false`; `ORCHESTRATOR_ENABLED=false`; `NIGHTLY_DISCOVERY_ENABLED=false` |

**Post-merge state**  
The checked-in Replit defaults are now fail-safe for the legacy discovery/outreach/orchestrator switches. Final closure still requires confirming that the deployed runtime environment has not overridden those checked-in defaults and that selective profile resolution does not instantiate excluded outbound capabilities.

---

## 6. Release / Repository Governance Observations

### GOV-01 — Repository is public

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `OBSERVATION` |
| Repository visibility | `public` |

Public visibility is not automatically a defect, but secret containment and generated-artifact hygiene must therefore be treated as hard requirements.

### GOV-02 — No repository rulesets returned by GitHub API

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `EVIDENCE GAP / GOVERNANCE REVIEW` |

The GitHub API returned an empty ruleset list. Traditional branch-protection configuration could not be read with the connected GitHub integration because the integration lacks the necessary administration permission.

**Do not infer** that branch protection is absent solely from that 403. Final governance review still needs authoritative branch-protection evidence.

### GOV-03 — Quick source token-prefix search found no obvious GitHub/OpenAI/Google API tokens

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | `PARTIAL EVIDENCE ONLY` |

This was a bounded source search, not a complete secret scan. Final security certification still requires the full repository/build-artifact secret-scanning gate to execute successfully.

---

## 7. Audit Coverage Register

**Current sequencing authority:** Section 14 records the owner’s 2026-10-01 update: Stages 1 and 2 are completed, fixed, and merged; Stage 3 is next. Older findings and evidence gaps remain historical audit evidence until independently reverified.

This register answers **what was actually tested**, not what the code claims to support.

| Audit lane | Current status | What has been done | What is still required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Safety & Environment Preflight | `COMPLETED / FIXED / MERGED — OWNER CONFIRMED 2026-10-01; FINAL CERTIFICATION PENDING` | GL-01 fixes independently verified in current publish-marked head; clean-runner install now succeeds; session/proposal/export/config/pre-deploy corrections preserved | Current head CI must be green; exact serving runtime SHA/profile/migration/queue evidence; role/runtime failure-injection checks |

## 10. Change Log

### 2026-10-01 — Reference audits and GHL sync posture added to Stage 3

Added a bottom section to the Stage 3 plan requiring full verification/reconciliation of both supplied October dashboard audits, including reported bugs, positive claims, cleanup history, GHL observations and conflicting snapshots. Owner specifies outbound emails remain paused while GHL data sync stays enabled and operational. Reference recommendations to unpause email, raise send caps or run cleanup are not adopted as authorization. No live state was changed or independently verified. See Section 16.

### 2026-10-01 — Stage 3 audit and redesign game plan authored

Created the Stage 3 CRM audit and redesign game plan with five passes: complete inventory; role/route/tab/action verification; sales journeys and data reconciliation; navigation/UI design; prioritized remediation and re-test. Added Section 15 with scope, deliverables, proposed navigation, and stage ownership. No new repository/runtime verification or defect closure occurred. Stage 3 remains next, with the live audit pending.

### 2026-10-01 — Owner stage completion and sequence update

Owner confirms Stages 1 and 2 have been completed, fixed, and merged. Added the authoritative ten-stage sequence in Section 14, set Stage 3 as the next audit, and established mandatory ledger updates after every task and audit. This is an owner-status update, not a new repository/runtime audit. Prior discovery evidence and unresolved independent-verification requirements are retained. Section 14 supersedes the older Stage 3 deferral in Section 13.3. No new SHA, CI result, deployment, or runtime verdict is asserted.

### 2026-10-01 — Stage 1/2 post-merge re-audit

Re-pinned to current publish-marked `main` `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` and migration head `0312_contact_business_system_links`. Verified GL-01 fixes remain implemented and the old clean-runner dependency-install failure is closed. Found current CI red on stale SFP structural assertions after a safer implementation refactor and found GL-02 residuals in public claim governance, strict public-form validation, raw click-ID authority, and CI registration of GL-02 regression tests. Stage 3 remains deferred until this bounded closure pass is complete.

### 2026-09-28 — Ledger created

Seeded from the fresh GitHub/current-code Safety & Environment Preflight plus revalidated historical go-live findings.

Initial current findings recorded:

- `SEC-01` — internal deal proposal read authorization defect.
- `SEC-02` — session validity authority fails open on lookup error.
- `REL-01` — GitHub CI blocked by Replit-internal package URLs in lockfile.
- `REL-02` — pre-deploy provider-deny boundary mismatch.
- `ADS-01` — offline conversion export over-broad to agents.
- `REL-03` — exact deployed runtime SHA not independently proven.
- `CFG-01` — latent armed legacy outreach/orchestrator configuration.

Historical findings revalidated and retained:

- `ENR-H01` — #2002 Sunbiz backfill worker-profile omission fixed in current source; runtime closure pending.
- `ENR-H02` — SFP `ready_held` → paused enrollment bridge now implemented; runtime closure pending.
- `SEC-H01` — September AI/CRM authorization family substantially remediated, with `SEC-01` still open.

Coverage register initialized for the full fresh go-live audit program.

## 11. Next Audit Entry

**Next lane:** Stage 3 — CRM & Sales Operations
**Execution plan:** [Stage 3 CRM Audit and Redesign Game Plan](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_bdb0fc8cc3bc8191bf890e19796ccbbc); authored 2026-10-01. Live audit pending.  
**Method requirement:** Fresh current repository + authenticated CRM walkthrough by real role + sales-workflow/data tracing; historical reports are checklists/evidence only, never treated as current truth.  
**Do not close this lane until:** accessible CRM routes, tabs, filters, actions/mutations, object permissions, loading/error/empty/degraded states, mobile/desktop behavior, and the rep workflow have actual evidence. See Section 14 for the current sequencing authority.


---

## 12. Public Website & Inbound — Fresh Audit Entry (2026-09-28)

**Audit SHA:** `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0`  
**Methods used:** current GitHub source + deployed public-site HTTP/HTML inspection.  
**Not performed:** no Replit interaction; no production mutation; no real-lead form submissions; no authenticated cloud-browser session. Interactive browser/mobile/console certification remains pending because that execution surface was unavailable in this chat.

### WEB-01 — Public merchant terms contradict each other on contracts and early termination fees

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Commercial Claims |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `PARTIAL — core conversion pages corrected; affiliate/partner public claim residuals remain` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary surfaces | Homepage, Get Started, Merchant Application, FAQ/Help, Terms, Refund Policy |

**Finding**  
Customer-facing pages state variants of `Cancel Anytime. No Early Termination Fee. No Penalty.` and `no cancellation fees`, while the Terms/Refund Policy and global footer state that agreements may have 1–3 year terms and early termination fees may apply, including a stated typical range of roughly $295–$595.

**Why it matters**  
These are contradictory statements about a material commercial term. A merchant should not receive a categorical no-ETF promise on a conversion page while the governing/legal pages say an ETF may apply.

**Required correction**  
Establish one governed contract/ETF claim and use conditional language everywhere unless the exact offer is guaranteed to be a no-ETF program. Bind marketing copy, FAQ/help, application copy, AI/knowledge content, SSR pages, and legal disclosures to that authority.

---

### WEB-02 — Merchant application forces PEWC/TCPA marketing consent despite saying consent is not required for service

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Application / Consent |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — PEWC no longer required to submit; browser/runtime verification pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary file | `client/src/pages/MerchantApplication.tsx` |

**Finding**  
Final-step progression requires `reviewConfirmed && pewcConsent`. The immediately adjacent PEWC disclosure says the applicant understands this consent is **not required to obtain services**. The server finalize DTO itself treats `pewcConsent` as optional, so the mandatory behavior is a frontend constraint rather than a backend necessity.

**Required correction**  
Separate application/underwriting assent from optional automated marketing/contact consent. A user must be able to submit the merchant application after accepting required application terms without being forced to grant optional PEWC marketing consent.

---

### WEB-03 — Free Analysis requires marketing-contact consent to obtain the advertised free analysis

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Lead Capture / Consent |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — marketing consent no longer required to obtain Free Analysis; runtime verification pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary file | `client/src/pages/FreeAnalysis.tsx` |

**Finding**  
The final Free Analysis step cannot proceed unless the marketing checkbox is checked. The checkbox grants calls, texts, and email marketing communications. This makes marketing consent a condition of receiving the advertised free analysis, while other forms correctly treat PEWC as optional.

**Required correction**  
Separate the requested service response from optional marketing-channel consent. Preserve transactional response authority without converting service submission into mandatory promotional consent.

### PRIV-01 — Cookie preferences do not control GA4/Meta loading; Google Consent Mode is absent

| Field | Value |

| Primary files | `client/src/components/CookieConsent.tsx`; `client/src/lib/tracking.ts` |

**Finding**  
The cookie banner stores `necessary/analytics/marketing/functional` choices in localStorage. The tracking module initializes at module load and injects GA4 and Meta Pixel whenever their IDs are configured. It does not read the stored preferences and contains no Google Consent Mode calls (`gtag('consent', ...)`).

**Why it matters**  
`Reject Non-Essential` / custom preferences are not currently demonstrated to control analytics/marketing tag execution. The banner and the actual tag behavior are separate systems.

**Required correction**  
Default analytics/marketing consent appropriately before tag initialization, wire banner state to the tag layer, implement/validate Consent Mode where required, and add browser tests proving tag/network behavior for accept/reject/custom states.

### ATTR-01 — Click-ID attribution is incomplete and inconsistent across public conversion paths

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Attribution / Ads |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `PARTIAL — GCLID/booking continuity improved; raw FBCLID/MSCLKID authority remains unresolved` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary files | `client/src/lib/utm.ts`; `client/src/pages/FreeAnalysis.tsx`; booking URL helper; acquisition reporting |

**Finding**  
The canonical UTM helper stores raw `gclid`, but only boolean presence for `fbclid` and `msclkid`; raw Meta/Microsoft click IDs are not preserved. Booking links propagate UTM values but not click IDs. Free Analysis manually captures only UTM query keys into its local state, then sends `utmParams.gclid`, which is never populated by that local capture path. Acquisition readiness also contains historical/stale `gclidCaptureActive: false` reporting despite other forms now capturing GCLID.

**Required correction**  
Define one governed acquisition-attribution payload and use it on every public form and booking handoff. Preserve supported raw click IDs where policy allows, report capture truthfully, and test source continuity from landing page through contact/deal and offline conversion export.

### INB-01 — Callback intake has weak identity/deduplication semantics

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Inbound CRM |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `MERGED — phone identity/ambiguity review implemented; isolated runtime canary pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary route | `POST /api/public/callback` |

**Finding**  
Callback intake has no email identifier and always calls `writeContact()` with `email: ""`. The public-form consolidation service explicitly exempts callback from the normal existing-contact path. Repeated legitimate callback submissions with different idempotency keys can therefore create multiple contacts/deals for the same phone/person unless a deeper writer constraint happens to stop them. Current clients validate only non-empty name/phone, not a normalized telephone identity.

**Required correction**  
Give callback requests an explicit phone-based identity/review policy rather than blind create. Preserve distinct request occurrences while linking them to the same canonical contact when identity is sufficiently strong, and route ambiguity to review rather than duplicating contacts.

---

### INB-02 — Several public clients generate idempotency keys per HTTP attempt, not per logical submission

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Inbound Reliability |
| Severity | `P2` |
| Status | `MERGED — stable logical-submission keys implemented across audited public clients; replay canary pending` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |
| Primary file | `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` |

**Finding**  
The server-side inbound claim system is strong, but the generic `apiRequest()` creates a new UUID whenever a public POST is issued without an explicit key. Get Started, Estimate, callback widgets, support and other callers do not all retain a key across an ambiguous timeout/retry. Statement Upload and Free Analysis do retain a logical-submission key and demonstrate the safer pattern.

**Why it matters**  
If the first request commits but the browser loses the response, a user retry can receive a new key and become a second request occurrence, defeating replay protection at the client boundary.

**Required correction**  
Generate one key per logical form submission and retain it through retries until definitive success/reset for every durable public mutation.

### INB-03 — Server-side hostile-input validation is inconsistent across public lead forms

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Inbound Validation |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `PARTIAL — estimate/support/get-started improved; callback and Free Analysis still lack full strict bounded server schemas` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |

**Finding**  
Several frontends have useful Zod/client validation, but equivalent server schemas are not uniformly enforced. Examples: Free Analysis checks only first name + email at route entry; callback accepts non-empty strings; estimate/get-started/support handlers destructure request bodies without a route-level Zod contract. Public rate limiting and field allowlists reduce blast radius but do not replace server validation.

**Required correction**  
Create canonical server-side schemas for every public form: bounded lengths, normalized email/phone, allowed enums, numeric/range constraints, unexpected-field policy, and safe error codes. Keep frontend validation as UX, not authority.

### WEB-04 — Merchant application contains unresolved `[Bank Partner]` production placeholder

| Field | Value |

| Primary file | `client/src/pages/MerchantApplication.tsx` |

**Finding**  
The application review/success UI still renders `Liberty Bancard is a registered ISO of [Bank Partner]` in current source.

**Required correction**  
Replace with the approved exact disclosure, or remove the unsupported bank-partner wording until a canonical legal disclosure is available. No placeholder may ship on the production application journey.

### WEB-05 — Public claims have multiple content authorities and are already drifting

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / SEO / Claim Governance |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `PARTIAL — homepage authority improved; public affiliate/partner claims remain outside canonical claim governance` |

| Primary files | `client/src/lib/site-content.ts`; `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`; `server/ssr/home.ts`; `server/ssr/pages.ts`; compare/help/legal content |

**Finding**  
`site-content.ts` declares itself the canonical public marketing-claim contract, but major pages and SSR files still hardcode statistics, savings claims, testimonials, contract claims, and offer language independently. Current live HTML and source show materially different claim sets across routes. Examples include a hardcoded homepage fees-identified statistic outside the canonical stats object and multiple different savings ranges on Statement Upload, Estimate, comparison and other pages.

**Required correction**  
Create one versioned claim registry/provenance contract for commercial claims used by client pages, SSR, FAQ/help, sales content and AI knowledge. Claims should carry source/effective date/qualifiers and fail review when unsupported or contradictory.

### WEB-06 — Current public accessibility/performance certification is not executable evidence

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / UX / Accessibility / Performance |
| Severity | `EVIDENCE` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |

**Finding / gap**  
The repository contains historical visual QA and an SEO crawler, but no current Axe/Pa11y/Lighthouse-style accessibility/performance gate was found. Source contains many good accessibility practices, but that does not prove keyboard order, contrast, focus behavior, responsive overflow, CLS/LCP/INP, console errors, or real mobile usability on the current deployed build.

**Required evidence**  
Interactive browser certification at representative mobile/desktop widths plus automated accessibility/performance measurements on the final candidate.

### INB-E01 — Production inbound assignment policy is not proven from GitHub

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Inbound Sales Handoff |
| Severity | `EVIDENCE` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Discovered at SHA | `8bf8318762963eb2298aad386b136c7361de54e0` |

**Source result**  
The current inbound authority correctly creates assignment evidence, one request-owned task and an SLA deadline derived from source receipt time. Missing/invalid assignment policy or exhausted capacity leaves the request review-required instead of falsely claiming assignment.

**Evidence still required**  
GitHub does not contain the live value of `INBOUND_ASSIGNMENT_POLICY_JSON`. Production must prove that the actual reps, active flags, territories, capacities and ownership identifiers are configured and that one isolated inbound canary lands on the intended rep/task/SLA.

---

### Public-site positive controls verified in source

The following are retained as positive evidence, not findings:

- Public lead endpoints are rate-limited in production.
- JSON public intake is durably claimed before business mutation.
- Statement Upload has a stable client idempotency key, content fingerprint and durable command handoff.
- Statement file uploads are memory-bounded to 10 MB and MIME-filtered.
- Existing email-identified public contacts use a protected merge path that prevents public forms from overwriting DNC/status/readiness/GHL/compliance fields.
- Sales-form requests create request-owned work links and SLA evidence.
- Missing assignment authority does not silently report a successful assignment.
- Statement Upload, Get Started and Estimate allow PEWC to remain unchecked; the forced-consent defects are not universal.
- Production CSP no longer includes `unsafe-inline` for scripts; development retains it only for HMR.

### Public Website & Inbound closure state

**Current lane status: `NOT CERTIFIED — POST-MERGE RESIDUALS + INTERACTIVE RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`.**

Source/HTTP audit is complete enough to identify the current structural defects above. Final lane certification still requires:

1. exact deployed SHA identity;
2. interactive desktop/mobile walkthrough of all public route families;
3. browser console/network evidence;
4. consent-banner accept/reject/custom network proof;
5. isolated form canaries proving contact/deal/ticket creation, dedupe, assignment, task/SLA and receipt replay;
6. failure/degraded rehearsal without real prospect sends;
7. current accessibility/performance measurements;
8. revalidation after remediation.

## 13. Stage 1 + Stage 2 Post-Merge Verification — 2026-10-01

**Audited current GitHub `main`:** `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827`  
**Commit title:** `Published your App`  
**Migration journal:** 317 entries; head `0312_contact_business_system_links`  
**Method:** independent current-tree review plus GitHub Actions evidence. No Replit messaging and no production mutation.

### 13.1 GL-01 / Stage 1 implementation result

Owning merged commit: `420f15f363480c3c422f98d36209964e85e7c4f3`.

The six GL-01 corrections are still present in the current publish-marked tree:

- `SEC-01`: internal deal proposal read now uses `isDashboardUser` plus `authorizeDealAccess()`.
- `SEC-02`: session-validity authority failure now returns `session_validation_unavailable` and protected guards fail closed with a retryable `503` rather than treating authority failure as valid.
- `REL-01`: GitHub-hosted `npm ci` now succeeds and the Replit-internal tarball-host defect is absent from the active lockfile. CI run `#407` completed dependency installation and locked-dependency policy successfully.
- `REL-02`: `scripts/run-pre-deploy.sh` now establishes the repository's provider-deny/zero-egress boundary around the server-required certification process rather than only enabling GHL fail-fast.
- `ADS-01`: offline-conversion export is now `admin`/`manager` only.
- `CFG-01`: checked-in `NIGHTLY_DISCOVERY_ENABLED`, `LEGACY_OUTREACH_ENABLED`, and `ORCHESTRATOR_ENABLED` are all `false`.

**Stage 1 implementation verdict:** `MERGED AND PRESERVED IN CURRENT HEAD`.

This is **not** the same as final Platform / Security / Release certification. Exact production identity, runtime role behavior, runtime environment overrides, and a green full current-head CI are still required.

### REL-04 — Current publish-marked head is release-red because the SFP structural regression test is stale against the safer current implementation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Platform / Release + Prospecting / Enrichment |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN — RELEASE GATE / TEST DRIFT` |
| Observed at SHA | `74a5307b2c4dcfd9e5e09fefa3ce1a14603e0827` |
| GitHub Actions | CI run `#407`, run id `36844957258` |
| Failing suite | `scripts/test-sfp-pipeline-correction.mjs` |

**Evidence**

The old clean-install blocker is fixed: dependency install, locked dependency policy, and manifest validation all passed. The deterministic suite then failed on two source-shape assertions.

A deeper current-tree inspection shows the intended safety properties are present:

1. `sfp-validation.ts` awaits `db.transaction(...)`, whose callback returns `openSfpCandidatePlaintext(...)`; plaintext remains inside the audited callback/transaction boundary and the boundary itself rejects plaintext escape. The static test still requires the obsolete literal shape `await openSfpCandidatePlaintext(`.
2. `sfp-validation.ts` calls `isCanonicallySuppressed([emailHash, contactEmailTokenHash], tx)` before provider use and again after provider wait. The static test regex expects a one-argument `isCanonicallySuppressed([...])` source shape and therefore fails when the transaction executor is passed as the second argument.

Because the static job failed, the external dependency/build-scan steps after it and the Integration Tests job did not complete.

**Interpretation**

This is a **release-gate/test-drift defect**, not currently evidence that the SFP runtime implementation lost the two safety properties. The test must be updated to assert the current behavioral/structural contract without pinning an obsolete call-site spelling. The safety assertions themselves must not be removed.

**Required closure**

- Update `scripts/test-sfp-pipeline-correction.mjs` so it recognizes the current audited transaction/plaintext-boundary call and the two-hash suppression call with its transaction executor.
- Keep assertions that plaintext cannot escape and that both candidate + contact hashes are suppression-checked before and after provider wait.
- Re-run the exact current-head CI through static, external-security, build-scan, and integration stages.

### 13.2 GL-02 / Stage 2 implementation result

Owning merged commit identified during the audit: `5885c35d582108cbb9f4aaaec17ef3a89d5de75e`.

**Confirmed landed and preserved**

- Merchant application PEWC is optional; required review/application assent remains separate.
- Free Analysis no longer requires marketing consent to proceed.
- Cookie consent now drives Google Consent Mode state and Meta initialization rather than being a storage-only banner.
- Explicit unchecked optional consent is no longer automatically converted into an opt-out in the corrected audited paths.
- Public clients audited by GL-02 now retain stable per-logical-submission idempotency keys instead of relying on a new generic key per HTTP retry.
- Callback intake now normalizes phone identity, reuses one unambiguous contact, and sends multiple-match ambiguity into durable review rather than picking/duplicating blindly.
- The merchant application `[Bank Partner]` placeholder is removed.
- Homepage headline/stat rendering now consumes the canonical public-site content registry rather than the old hard-coded count-up values.
- Estimate, Support, and Get Started now have bounded server-side schemas.

**Stage 2 implementation verdict:** `PARTIAL — MATERIAL RESIDUALS REMAIN`.

### WEB-01R — Public contract/ETF claim drift remains on affiliate/partner public surfaces

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Commercial Claims |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Current evidence | `client/src/pages/AffiliateProgram.tsx`; `client/src/pages/PartnerBrandedPage.tsx` |

The core Get Started and Merchant Application blanket no-ETF copy was corrected, but current public source still contains:

- Affiliate Program sales talking point: `No long-term contracts or early termination fees`.
- Public partner-branded page: `Zero Risk to Switch` / `No early termination risk`.

These remain inconsistent with the governed Terms/Refund disclosures that some programs can carry 1–3 year terms and ETFs.

**Required closure:** route the affiliate/partner claims through the same conditional commercial-term authority and extend claim regression coverage beyond the two original pages.

### WEB-05R — Claim authority is still incomplete outside the homepage/core forms

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Claim Governance |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Current evidence | `client/src/pages/PartnerBrandedPage.tsx`; `client/src/pages/AffiliateProgram.tsx`; `client/src/lib/site-content.ts` |

The canonical registry now owns the homepage statistics, but public partner/affiliate content still hard-codes broader commercial/savings claims such as `Most businesses save 20–40% when they switch`. The current `test-claim-authority.ts` does not prove that all public claim-bearing surfaces consume the canonical authority.

**Required closure:** extend canonical claim ownership/provenance and the scanner to the complete public route/content inventory rather than only the original Get Started/Merchant Application/Home examples.

### INB-03R — Strict server validation is still incomplete for callback and Free Analysis

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Inbound Validation |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Current evidence | `server/routes/public.ts` callback handler; `server/routes/imports.ts` free-analysis handler |

Estimate, Support, and Get Started now use explicit bounded Zod schemas. Callback still destructures the public body before an equivalent strict bounded schema, and Free Analysis still begins from raw request fields with only a small required-field check before downstream processing.

**Required closure:** apply the GL-02 strict-schema contract to those remaining lead-intake handlers, including field bounds, normalized phone/email, enums/ranges, unexpected-field policy, and safe error responses.

### ATTR-01R — Raw Meta/Microsoft click-ID authority remains unresolved

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Attribution / Ads |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Current evidence | `client/src/lib/utm.ts`; `shared/schema.ts`; booking attribution helper |

GL-02 improved GCLID persistence and now propagates GCLID/landing page through booking handoffs. `fbclid` and `msclkid`, however, are still reduced to presence booleans in the common helper rather than retained as governed raw click IDs. No matching canonical raw fields or explicit corrected presence-only attribution contract was found.

**Required closure:** either preserve the approved raw click IDs end-to-end for the later ads/offline-feedback authority, or explicitly define and test a different canonical contract that does not require them. Do not leave the implementation halfway between those models.

### WEB-07 — GL-02 regression suites are not registered in the canonical CI suite manifest

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lane | Public Website / Release Assurance |
| Severity | `P1` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Current evidence | `scripts/ci-suite-manifest.ts` plus GL-02 test files |

GL-02 added focused tests including:

- `scripts/test-claim-authority.ts`
- `scripts/test-cookie-consent-tracking.ts`
- `scripts/test-consent-unchecked-not-optout.ts`
- `scripts/test-callback-identity.ts`
- `scripts/test-callback-review-disposable.ts`
- `scripts/test-public-route-validation.ts`

The current canonical CI suite manifest does not register these task-owned regression suites. A developer can therefore regress GL-02 behavior without the canonical current CI necessarily exercising those tests.

**Required closure:** register the applicable deterministic/static/disposable suites in the canonical manifest with correct isolation metadata; prove CI actually executes them.

### 13.3 Stage transition decision

**Historical decision — superseded for sequencing by the owner’s completion update in Section 14.** Preserve the findings and verification requirements below; they do not override the current instruction to proceed to Stage 3.

Do **not** mark Stage 2 certified and do **not** start Stage 3 as though the inbound/public baseline were closed.

The bounded next closure pass is:

1. close `WEB-01R` / `WEB-05R` public claim residuals;
2. close `INB-03R` callback + Free Analysis strict validation;
3. close or explicitly resolve `ATTR-01R` before the later Ads/Attribution lane;
4. register GL-02 regression tests (`WEB-07`);
5. repair `REL-04` stale SFP structural regression assertions without weakening the intended safety contract;
6. re-run current-head CI and Stage 1/2 source verification;
7. perform the remaining interactive browser/runtime canaries when that execution surface is available;
8. then begin Stage 3 CRM & Sales Operations against the corrected baseline.

## 14. Authoritative Go-Live Stage Sequence and Owner Update — 2026-10-01

**Authority:** Owner instruction in the current conversation.  
**Update type:** Program sequencing and reported task-completion status; no fresh source or runtime audit was performed for this update.  
**Ledger role:** Continuing reference and working record for all remaining Go-Live tasks and audits. Update this same document after every task and every audit.

### 14.1 Current progress

- **Stage 1:** Completed, fixed, and merged — owner confirmed.
- **Stage 2:** Completed, fixed, and merged — owner confirmed.
- **Stage 3:** Next audit stage; game plan authored 2026-10-01; live audit not yet performed. See Section 15.
- **Stages 4–8:** Remaining staged work; historical source reviews do not establish fresh end-to-end completion.
- **Stage 9:** Final certification intentionally deferred until prior product lanes have finished remediation. No release SHA freeze now.
- **Stage 10:** Final nine lane-specific GO/NO-GO verdicts remain pending.

The owner’s completion report supersedes the earlier instruction in Section 13.3 to defer Stage 3. Preserve the older residual findings and discovery evidence. Do not label them independently CLOSED merely from this status update. At the next relevant verification, append their fixing task/merge SHA, deployment evidence, regression results, and runtime evidence, or retain an explicit verification gap. This does not reopen owner-completed tasks merely because old evidence has not yet been refreshed.

### 14.2 Fixed sequence

| Stage | Audit / task stage | Required scope | Current program status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Current-state safety preflight | Confirm production is stable enough to test: auth is not catastrophically open; outbound/send gates paused; provider spend controlled; test data isolated; DB/Redis healthy enough; approximate running version known. This is an audit-safety check, with no SHA freeze. | COMPLETED / FIXED / MERGED — owner confirmed |
| 2 | Public website + inbound acquisition | Exercise every form, CTA, attribution path, consent state, validation/error behavior, CRM creation, assignment, dedupe, SLA/task creation, mobile behavior, and degraded integration case. | COMPLETED / FIXED / MERGED — owner confirmed |
| 3 | CRM + sales operations | Walk the authenticated CRM by real role; exercise actual routes, tabs, filters, buttons, mutations, loading/error/empty states, permissions, mobile/desktop, and the rep workflow. | NEXT |
| 4 | Prospecting/enrichment + campaigns/outbound | Prove #1998–#2002, Sunbiz, free enrichment, Serper/OpenAI/Apollo/Outscraper/ZeroBounce, the five verticals, campaign staging, enrollment, suppression, bounce/reply handling, worker profiles, and schedules end to end. | PENDING — historical partial source evidence retained |
| 5 | Application → underwriting → processor → MID | Exercise the merchant application lifecycle with protected test records and processor sandbox/canaries. | PENDING |
| 6 | Onboarding → support → processor activity → residuals → commissions/revenue | Prove the post-sale business closes the loop across these workflows. | PENDING |
| 7 | Ads, attribution and conversion measurement | Finish landing pages, UTM/click IDs, GA4, Google/Meta, offline conversions, consent behavior, deduplication, conversion taxonomy, budgets, and stop thresholds. | PENDING — historical partial source evidence retained |
| 8 | Sales training + AI operational readiness | Finalize the rep workflow, approved claims, talk tracks, AI permissions, coaching, certification, and documentation against the CRM that now exists. | PENDING |
| 9 | Platform / Security / Release FINAL certification | Stop feature changes; fix remaining security/release defects from all prior lanes; freeze one SHA; run full CI/security/migration/role/IDOR/build suites; publish that exact SHA; verify it live; verify workers/queues/Redis/integrations/kill switches; test rollback/recovery; bind all certification evidence to that release. | DEFERRED UNTIL PRIOR LANES COMPLETE |
| 10 | Final lane-specific GO/NO-GO | Issue nine separate verdicts using Section 8, each with its certified SHA and evidence. | PENDING |

Stage 4 covers both Prospecting & Enrichment and Campaigns & Outbound; those receive separate final verdicts. Stage 1 is the preliminary safety pass; Stage 9 provides the final Platform / Security / Release verdict. Thus ten ordered stages produce the nine final lane verdicts already listed in Section 8.

### 14.3 Mandatory update after every task and audit

1. Record the date, stage number, task/audit identity, exact SHA reviewed, and methods used. If no code was reviewed, say so; do not reuse an old SHA as though newly audited.
2. Append new findings with stable IDs and evidence. Preserve original discovery evidence and previously recorded fixes.
3. For existing findings, record task ownership, merge SHA, deployment identity, tests actually executed, runtime verification, and the resulting status. Distinguish owner-reported completion from independent verification.
4. Update the coverage register, current stage progress, next audit entry, and change log. Keep unexercised paths explicitly UNTESTED and unavailable evidence explicit.
5. Carry unresolved cross-lane items to the relevant later stage and final certification without silently losing them or restarting completed tasks without fresh evidence of a remaining defect.
6. Save the updated version to this same existing file after every task/audit. Preserve file identity and version history.
7. Keep Section 8 verdicts uncertified until lane evidence and final release binding support them. Never substitute a single company-wide readiness claim for the nine verdicts.

**Next action when the Stage 3 audit is invoked:** Refresh repository/runtime identity and role inventory, then perform the authenticated CRM + sales operations audit. Record all resulting findings and coverage here. No live audit, production mutation, provider activation, or outbound action is authorized merely by this ledger-reference update.

## 15. Stage 3 CRM Audit and Redesign Game Plan — 2026-10-01

**Status:** `PLAN AUTHORED — LIVE AUDIT PENDING`.  
**Task:** Stage 3 game-plan authoring requested by the owner. No build task number assigned.  
**Plan:** [Liberty Bancard Stage 3 CRM Audit and Redesign Game Plan](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_bdb0fc8cc3bc8191bf890e19796ccbbc).  
**Companion file:** `LIBERTY_BANCARD_STAGE_3_CRM_AUDIT_AND_REDESIGN_GAMEPLAN.md`.  
**Methods:** Read the historical CRM UI/tab audit, canonical-source audit, execution roadmap, end-to-end lifecycle roadmap, and the current ledger. Designed the execution plan and proposed reconciliation from those references and the owner’s scope.  
**SHA reviewed during this authoring task:** None. Historical reference SHAs are labelled in the plan; the last independently audited baseline in Section 2 is unchanged.  
**Runtime/browser tests:** Not performed. No source, production, provider, outbound or permission changes made.

### 15.1 Execution passes

| Pass | Scope | Required evidence/output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Refresh current source/runtime identity and inventory all routes, navigation, tabs and actions | Full register with current denominator, roles, APIs, authority and lifecycle |
| 2 | Authenticated role walkthrough and direct route/API/action verification | Expected/actual, persisted effect, failure/retry and role/object access results |
| 3 | Controlled rep/manager sales journeys and data reconciliation | Workflow breaks, count/identity/ownership truth, click/time/performance baseline |
| 4 | Navigation reconciliation and UI/workflow design | Exact old-to-new route/tab/action map; shared design specification; desktop/mobile prototype |
| 5 | Prioritized bounded repairs, implementation and re-test | Task/merge/deployment/runtime evidence, regression coverage, updated ledger |

### 15.2 Proposed navigation

Initial candidates, pending current inventory and user-workflow validation:

- Work and Sales: My Day, People, Businesses, Pipeline, Inbox, Tasks/Calendar, Ready for Outreach, Statements/Proposals.
- Lead Operations: raw inventory/sources, imports, discovery, enrichment, identity review, classification, data quality, run history.
- Campaigns and Delivery: campaigns, sequences, audience/preflight, delivery analytics, deliverability.
- Merchant Operations: applications, underwriting, boarding/onboarding, portfolio, support/RFIs, merchant health, residuals/commissions.
- Reporting: sales, team operations, acquisition, outreach, merchant/revenue.
- Administration and System: users/access, integrations, automation, queues/incidents, data integrity, consent/compliance, audit/release.
- Resources: knowledge, playbooks, collateral, training and scoped AI.

Preserve scoped partner/merchant portals and distinct partner/content/growth workspaces where the current inventory establishes their purpose. Keep a small daily navigation for agents, with contextual shortcuts to the canonical destination. Do not delete or merge modules merely from this proposal.

### 15.3 Coverage and closure requirements

Every current route, tab and action receives a tested or explicit blocked/untested/disposed result. Prove meaningful actions through the correct service and persisted outcome, not only clickability/toasts. Include ownership/role denials, direct URLs, invalid/stale/double/retry behavior, loaded/empty/error states, accessible desktop/mobile use, deep-link preservation and record/report consistency.

Stage 3 inspects the CRM surfaces for later-stage enrichment, campaign, application, processor, revenue and attribution workflows, but their full external operational proof stays in Stages 4–7. Training certification stays in Stage 8. Final release freeze/certification stays in Stage 9. Final nine lane verdicts remain uncertified.

**Next:** Run the Stage 3 current repository and authenticated CRM audit using the linked game plan; append findings with current source/runtime evidence. No audit results or independent closures are inferred from writing this plan.

## 16. Stage 3 Reference Audit Reconciliation and GHL Sync Instruction — 2026-10-01

**Status:** `PLAN UPDATED — REFERENCE FINDINGS UNVERIFIED`.  
**Owner instruction:** Use the two attached dashboard audits ONLY for reference; add a bottom section requiring verification and reconciliation of all findings. Keep outbound emails paused without turning GHL sync off.  
**Plan updated:** Section 13 of [Stage 3 CRM Audit and Redesign Game Plan](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_bdb0fc8cc3bc8191bf890e19796ccbbc), plus the opening operating-posture paragraph.  
**Sources read:** `Liberty Bancard — Dashboard Audit: Findings, Bugs & Fix List.docx`; `What's Broken (Oct 2026).docx`. Both are source claims, not current independent verification.  
**Source/runtime audit SHA:** None for this document update. No authenticated CRM/GHL testing, production configuration changes, cleanup or sends performed.

### 16.1 Required operating posture

- Outbound email stays paused across CRM and GHL-triggered paths.
- GHL data sync stays enabled and operational as a separate capability. Check actual effective configuration, worker progress, mapping and receipts. If currently off, identify the defect and recovery path; do not falsely mark it active.
- Synchronization must not cause downstream email through tags/stages/workflow enrollment that bypasses the pause. Verify local transport and external workflow effects separately.
- UI must show separate truthful sync and sending states; stale/unavailable sync cannot be “All Systems Healthy.”
- Do not broadly enable killed jobs, publish workflows, raise sending caps, push raw inventory, or recreate reported fake opportunities from stale IDs.

### 16.2 Reference coverage added

The plan now explicitly crosswalks D1–D22, DEV-23–DEV-29, the reported miswired Delete Contact control, the developer P0-05 relationship-view requirement, G1–G11, all mirror comparisons, remaining section/route observations, claimed positive tests, sample-quality/scoring/activity assertions, recommendations and reported cleanup mutations.

For each claim require current evidence and a disposition: confirmed, partly confirmed, fixed verified, not reproduced, disproved, expected control, proposed upgrade, superseded state, or blocked/untested. Preserve original source IDs and dates. Reassess severity rather than copying a reference’s P0 label. Link duplicate claims to one canonical ledger finding without losing source traceability.

### 16.3 Conflicts and recommendations requiring special handling

- Email tests denied by a deliberate pause may be correct; do not unpause to pass them.
- The full audit’s earlier 1,175 GHL opportunities and the developer recap’s later reported zero after deletion must be reconciled. Do not migrate/restore those reported fake deals. A reported restore window is not an irreversible purge.
- Refresh cleanup counts, archive/delete/pause results and stalled real-sequence memberships; attachments grant no new destructive cleanup authorization.
- Resolve the explicitly corrected ticket identities, task/deal/notification count scopes, failed-create-after-commit behavior and sending-identity removal/reseed history.
- Local and GHL stage/workflow/user counts need semantic ownership/mapping, not forced numerical equality.
- Sample plausibility does not establish database-wide validated identity, email validity, target fit or eligibility. QQ-domain/numeric-local-part alone does not prove a bogus email.
- Do not purge immutable consent/audit evidence merely because IP/UA resembles a test.
- Form builders, one-to-one composer, invite/deactivate/archive controls and the complete merchant relationship view require current capability assessment; missing preferred controls are not automatically defects.

**Next:** Execute Stage 3 using the updated plan and settle all reference claims with current evidence. Stage 3 remains live-audit pending; final lane verdicts and reviewed-source baseline are unchanged.

## 17. Stage 3 Live CRM and Repository Audit — 2026-10-01

**Status:** `DISCOVERY / ACCESSIBLE ADMIN WALKTHROUGH RECORDED — STAGE 3 NO-GO; REMEDIATION AND CERTIFICATION OPEN`.
**Owner authorization:** Proceed with the full updated Stage 3 CRM audit through the cloud browser and audit the repo. Two dashboard audits remain reference-only.
**Report:** [Stage 3 CRM Audit Results and Redesign Specification](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_50935c4368b48191a57998a7e69abe8d).
**Companion artifacts:** `LIBERTY_BANCARD_STAGE_3_CRM_AUDIT_RESULTS.md`, five CSV registers, `CRM_WORKSPACE_DESIGN_PROTOTYPE.html`, `STAGE_3_CRM_AUDIT_EVIDENCE.zip`; the existing Stage 3 game-plan file/Page is updated with the execution status.
**New implementation task numbers:** None assigned.

### 17.1 Current baseline and controls

| Item | Independently observed evidence |
|---|---|
| Repository/source | `scottpstevenson/Liberty-Bancard-Website-and-CRM`, main `37ad19cb8c73492dbc3bf37ed7b50739b48c3315` |
| Reviewed tree | `9c25c9807349a7d2d7fc7daeadaae03bf64fd8b4` |
| Production health | `ok`, SHA `119079c9b52e06c36e8b7a7666ba0aec5791fa23`, built `2026-10-01T21:29:51.616Z`, production |
| Serving-source gap | Reported runtime SHA differs from GitHub; fetch returned “not our ref.” Source conclusions remain bound to reviewed SHA; deployed equivalence unproved. |
| Live role | Admin only; other roles reviewed in source and remain untested live. |
| Outbound | Global pause observed; no sends or unpause. |
| GHL sync | Found already killed, last run 26 days ago; data writes gated by send authority in reviewed source. Required independent sync remains OPEN. This audit did not disable it. |
| Automations | Current UI 12/19 killed; old 12/20 denominator superseded. Enabled status alone does not prove fresh execution. |
| Source / production mutation | No source fixes, commit, PR, deployment, cleanup, permissions/settings change, invitation, worker activation or provider run. Browser navigation/filter/dialog and rejected blank-input tests only. |
| Final SHA freeze | NO; Stage 9 only. |

### 17.2 Coverage and proof boundaries

146 explicit dashboard registrations: all 142 static paths reached; contact, canonical-business and mobile-contact fixtures cover three of four parameterized patterns (**145/146 route patterns traversed**). Company Detail fixture/consumer remains missing. Primary hubs, 22 Contact Detail sections and 46 operator panels explored. Operator click navigation is broken; panel review used parent-preserving deep links.

542 browser observations are preserved with evidence IDs; 309 tab/panel observation-context rows and 8,704 visible-control context rows are inventory entries, **not unique capability counts or mutation passes**. Selected dialog/required-field and search/status-filter behavior proved. Successful persisted mutations, full role/object allow/deny, mobile responsive/touch and native GHL data-canary/no-downstream-email proof remain blocked/untested. No percentage of all actions or roles is claimed.

### 17.3 New Stage 3 finding register

| Finding | Severity / proof limit | Discovery | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRM3-01 | EVIDENCE / release blocker | Production cannot be bound to the reviewed source | OPEN |
| CRM3-02 | P1 | Stock CI cannot install its lockfile | OPEN |
| CRM3-03 | P1 | GHL sync is killed and data writes share the send pause | OPEN |
| CRM3-04 | P1 | Connected/configured badges falsely imply operational health | OPEN |
| CRM3-05 | P1 | Work counts and AI briefing contradict actionable tasks | OPEN |
| CRM3-06 | P1 | Permissions audit silently returns zero routes | OPEN |

| CRM3-10 | P2 | Financial aliases select the wrong report | OPEN |
| CRM3-11 | P1 | Scope mismatches make lists and reports disagree | OPEN |
| CRM3-12 | P1 | Terminal ROI represents test/new-lead equipment as deployed | OPEN |
| CRM3-13 | P1 | Readiness and contactability advice disagree with actual permission | OPEN |
| CRM3-14 | P1, source-confirmed; live role proof pending | Cold-lead collection and bulk re-engagement lack agent scope | OPEN |
| CRM3-15 | P1 | Re-engagement audience label and value math are unsupported | OPEN |
| CRM3-16 | P1 | Sequence report counts are multiplied by a join | OPEN |
| CRM3-17 | P1, source-confirmed; manager runtime pending | Manager enrollment fetch contract produces misleading empty counts | OPEN |
| CRM3-18 | P1 | Assignment and SLA handoff do not create an actionable rep queue | OPEN |
| CRM3-19 | P1 | Launch probes contain schema-invalid queries | OPEN |
| CRM3-20 | P1, shared Stage 4/9 dependency | Enrichment runtime owner and worker health are not proved | OPEN |
| CRM3-21 | P2 | Dense workspaces bury the rep's next action | OPEN |
| CRM3-22 | P2 | Large panels and bundles need bounded loading | OPEN |
| CRM3-23 | P2 | Provisioning exists but is hard to discover; deactivation must be proved | OPEN |
| CRM3-24 | P2 | Empty and filtered states confuse missing data with missing matches | OPEN |
| CRM3-25 | P1 / EVIDENCE | Security and training readiness remain explicit follow-up items | OPEN |
| CRM3-26 | P2, shared Stages 5–6 | Lifecycle relationship workspace is incomplete | OPEN |

Detailed reproduction, reviewed-source causes, acceptance tests and later-stage ownership are in the report and findings register. These rows are discovery entries, not merged/deployed/closed fixes. Source-only role concerns require controlled live/runtime proof; do not label the site catastrophically open from an empty permissions audit.

### 17.4 Material data and health reconciliations

- Settled Home: 3,073 pending / 3,072 overdue; briefing 3,082 overdue; Tasks one future-due unassigned inbound follow-up. KPI/briefing predicates and AI prompt differ from active task storage.
- Production People default: 153,980; all-class email-health total: 154,382, including 402 Test. Production pipeline zero versus legacy/all-scope 1,572 deals needs explicit scope, not fake-deal restoration.
- GHL settings: 1,915 synced, 152,467 unsynced; read connection works, while killed/stale/error states contradict “All Systems Healthy.” Historical error totals are not asserted as current 24-hour failures.
- Sequence report step × enrollment join inflates counts. Reported 2,097 stalled / roughly 2,040 Referral Flywheel rows are not proved unique real contacts. No cleanup/resume based on them.
- Queue Holds response record/array mismatch crashes; Provider Results URL allowlist omission selects Businesses; operator view clicks lose parent hub tab; financial aliases select Revenue.

### 17.5 Validation evidence

Stock GitHub run 36926922128 / Static Checks job 110586426532 fails at dependency installation; integration skipped. Four lockfile URLs target the private Replit registry. Local stock install also fails. An isolated audit dependency copy rewrote only those four URLs, retaining integrity; repository lockfile/source unchanged.

With the documented workaround: CRM #2056 UI contracts, protected-object static authority, CR-04 static authority, GHL #1629 route pause gates (71 assertions), and Task #1721 structural checks PASS; TypeScript PASS with expanded heap; production client/server build PASS with recorded warnings. Audit runtime Node 24.19.0/npm 11.9.0 differs from prescribed Node 22.22.x/npm 10.9.4. DB/Redis-backed role/mutation/full security suite not run. No final CI/release certification claimed.

### 17.6 Reference reconciliation and design decisions

All D1–D22, DEV-23–DEV-29, unnumbered Delete Contact, P0-05 relationship upgrade, G1–G11, additional positive/negative claims and cleanup families have 69 reference-register rows and explicit dispositions. Native GHL/profile/phone/analytics states and per-record historical cleanup receipts remain blocked. Current counts supersede older snapshots only where observed. Missing composer/invite claims are disproved as absolute UI/capability claims; operational send/invite proof remains open.

No immutable consent/audit logs purged, no user/contact/ticket/sequence/opportunity deletion, no Referral Flywheel clearing, no 532,626-row source job/ZeroBounce batch and no fake GHL-deal rehydration.

Proposed Work/Sales, Lead Operations, Campaigns/Delivery, Merchant Operations, Reporting, Admin/System and Resources groupings retain current canonical authorities and working URLs first. Every route has a proposed group/disposition. Contact Detail becomes five areas plus persistent History. The fictional-data design preview demonstrates contextual note/task and readable related-record links; it proves no live API behavior.

### 17.7 Next work and closure rule

1. Repair access/control/navigation/DTO defects and portable dependency CI; establish accessible serving-source provenance.
2. Reconcile metrics, classes, readiness, sequence math and current worker/probe evidence. Decouple and recover safe data sync with all outbound email held and downstream GHL no-send proof.
3. Implement the scoped core sales workspace; execute protected successful mutations and actual manager/two-agent/merchant/partner/anonymous/session tests.
4. Close Company Detail, mobile/keyboard/accessibility, failure/retry and measured performance gaps; retest the complete registers.
5. Append actual task/PR/merge, deployed build and runtime closure evidence after every task/audit. Preserve this discovery history and earlier stages.

**Stage 3 NO-GO remains.** Stage 3 is not fully executed/certified by broad admin route coverage. Stages 4–8 retain their operational obligations; Stage 9 freezes one exact release; Stage 10 issues nine separate lane verdicts.

---

## 18. Stage 3 consolidated implementation specification — 2026-10-02

**State:** Discovery/reconciliation at documented scope complete; implementation and full functional certification NOT COMPLETE. No repair was implemented, merged, deployed or closed in this consolidation. Stages 1–2 remain completed/fixed/merged in the user’s go-live sequence. Stage 3 remains without an unconditional GO.

**Current working document:** [Liberty Bancard — Stage 3 consolidated implementation specification](https://chatgpt.com/space/page_01d5de8fcd688191a708d3ce9474077c). The accompanying file is `LIBERTY_BANCARD_STAGE_3_CONSOLIDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`; evidence is `STAGE_3_CONSOLIDATED_EVIDENCE.zip`. Prior plan/report and their evidence remain historical.

### 18.1 Updated source and production baseline

- GitHub main / reviewed source: `51edb7fb3b5698366faf05346f52cbb3a8461973`; tree `4e487f84ca16b002e306a9a190baf4778accf0c4`. Clean detached checkout; compared against original `37ad19cb8c73492dbc3bf37ed7b50739b48c3315`.
- Serving `/api/health`: `26a7da8bf96d80eb7a125bb6521e6140e3b5c8d5`, production, built `2026-10-02T10:36:34.721Z`, publishBuildId `ba1896d0-facc-417c-acb1-74c7ab780f89`, `ghlTransportFailFast=false`.
- GitHub fetch of serving commit returned No Commit Found (422). Serving source and reviewed main are not bound. Build identity now exists, superseding the older absence of a publishBuildId; provenance gap CRM3-01 remains open. This is not the Stage 9 SHA freeze.
- 19 source files changed, 566 additions/7 deletions, mainly SFP runtime/build identity/docs. CRM pages/routes/CSS, contacts/campaigns and package-lock unchanged. Confirmed old source cause anchors remain present; deployed equivalence still unproved.
- User restored cloud-browser sign-in. Scott admin session inspected; 26 fresh C-001–C-026 observations, including loading intermediates. Only settled observations support conclusions.

### 18.2 Consolidation accounting and dispositions

26 Stage 3 tracked entries + 69 reference claim families = 95 **source entries**, with substantial overlap. The specification assigns every entry one primary owner across **14 repair groups** and **four implementation tasks**. Neither 95 nor 14 is a verified unique defect total. Design proposals and pending claims are explicitly separate from confirmed causes.

The original 69 reference dispositions are preserved: 7 confirmed, 19 partial, 6 disproved, 20 blocked/untested, 3 superseded, 4 expected controls, 8 upgrades, 1 not reproduced, 1 declined recommendation. Fresh checks strengthen several rows without proving every subclaim. The bottom reference crosswalk retains all 69 claims and exact evidence/next actions. No unverified historical action is silently closed by count agreement or code existence.

The complete proposal includes all 146 dashboard route patterns and 309 observed panel entries. It preserves role boundaries, query/object context and legacy compatibility; proposes nine principal employee destinations plus Administration/Resources; five-area Contact and Lead Ops views; five Admin groups; shared metric authorities; exact current Liberty tokens/layout/typography; prioritized workflow upgrades and action acceptance contracts.

### 18.3 Fresh confirmed observations

- CRM3-06: Permissions still reports 0 of 0 registered API routes. Express 5 source uses `_router` extraction.
- CRM3-07: Queue Holds still crashes; visible error `(t.desiredLogicalHolds ?? []).map is not a function`. Source UI expects array while coordinator returns Record.
- CRM3-08: Provider Results click changes URL but Businesses stays selected. Source valid-tab list omits provider-results.
- CRM3-09: Worker Heartbeats click loses `tab=monitor`; System Readiness becomes selected.
- CRM3-10: Forecasting and Terminal ROI aliases both select Revenue. Source expects `financialTab`.
- CRM3-05: Home pending 3,075 / overdue 3,072; briefing overdue 3,082 with AI saying no immediate overdue alerts; settled Tasks shows 3 pending unassigned due October 6. Shared scope/status/deletion/asOf reconciliation still needed.
- CRM3-11: Contacts All/KPI 154,407 vs Production 154,005 and Test 402. Home production total 154,005. Different populations are real; same-label/scoped metrics must not obscure them.
- CRM3-13: Contact #159443 internal no-email placeholder earns 25/25 email readiness points while NBA correctly blocks global pause. Data readiness and send permission require separate truthful UI.
- CRM3-18: Current pipeline 2 and task 3 records are unassigned. Pipeline records display Liberty QATest; classification/intended fixture/archive receipts remain pending before any cleanup. Contact shows 3 linked deals vs 2 active pipeline; do not force unlike counts equal.
- CRM3-03/04: GHL Sync killed. Registry 19 automations / 12 killed. Integration says All Systems Healthy while entity rows have stale timestamps and 159 task / 6,929 deal / 1,174 company / 68,549 contact errors. Displayed counters are not unique current failed objects. Sync 1,915 / 154,407 and unsynced 152,492 use unclear predicates; another count 154,411 has unclear asOf/scope.
- Mapping now shows 2/19 local resolved and 4 external stages. Won/lost display same shortened external identifier; full IDs/semantic trigger behavior unverified. GHL stage counts are not required to equal local stage counts.
- CRM3-20: recent active enrichment zero-record run does not prove runtime ownership or queue/provider success. Later Stage 4/9 receipts remain required.

### 18.4 Proposed execution packages

| Task | Scope | Closure requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — shared authorities, access and sync policy | Source/build/CI; collection/bulk authorization; record and metric scope; enrollment aggregation; manager query contract; independent safe data sync | Portable clean CI, schema/scope tests, exact source/build mapping, fake transport no-send proof, reviewed native trigger safety before isolated sync enablement |
| B — rep workflow and recoverable lifecycle | Task/briefing/assignment/notifications; Inbox and permission; user provisioning/lifecycle; verified relationships; consent/privacy; archive/restore | Durable protected fixtures, eligible routing/dedupe/SLA receipts, correct permissions, cancellation/idempotency/cache/audit/restore proof |
| C1 — routes and shared UI foundation | Destination registry, legacy/tab compatibility, Liberty primitives, loading rules | All route/panel owners; role-safe aliases; tested responsive template; no premature shell cutover |
| C2 — daily sales workspace | Today, Records/contact, Pipeline, Inbox, Work; integrate A/B contracts | Durable rep actions, scoped metrics, real-role/mobile/state/context tests |
| C3 — Prospecting and Campaigns | Five Lead Ops areas, Provider Results, campaign local groups | Correct tabs/aliases and truthful staging/provider states; no-send/no-spend navigation |
| C4 — Merchant Operations and Reports | Lifecycle destinations, financial aliases, shared reporting layouts | Verified links and metric scopes; portal boundaries; Stage 5–6 execution remains separate |
| C5 — Administration, Resources and shell cutover | Five admin groups; Permissions/Queue Holds/Heartbeats; 11-entry shell | Functioning destinations first; safe roles/aliases; diagnostics; measured responsive/accessibility/performance proof |
| D — integrated reconciliation and Stage 3 closure | All reference findings, actual serving build, real roles/actions/metrics/mobile/degraded cases, native GHL/later-lane obligations | Complete evidence matrix and explicit scoped verdict; same document/ledger updated; remaining Stage 4–9 work retains separate owners |

Each task may contain small reviewed commits and its own checks; all testing is not deferred to D. Merged alone is not closed. No hard route removal without consumer inventory and compatibility retirement evidence. No identity merge by display name. No purge of immutable consent/audit records. No unsupported revenue/deliverability/stalled-count conclusions.

### 18.5 Safety and unproved coverage

Outbound communications remain intentionally paused. GHL data synchronization is required to work independently but is currently observed killed and shares the pause boundary. R03 / Task A defines capability separation, allowed noncommunicating fields, external trigger checks, independent sync worker and receipts. This session did not turn on workers, run Sync All, change a kill switch, purchase enrichment, enroll a sequence, send a message, change roles or delete/archive production data.

Real manager/agent/merchant/partner sessions, anonymous/IDOR negative mutations, narrow viewport/touch, durable CRUD/lifecycle, degraded integration responses, native GHL and no-send sync canaries remain unproved. The original 8,704 control observations are not unique button passes; 145/146 route reach and 309 panels are traversal evidence only. No new full CI/security/database/build/role certification is claimed.

**Next authorized scope:** use the consolidated document to execute the grouped implementation work with explicit acceptance and evidence. The current task produced a reviewable specification, not a production release. Stage 3 cannot receive unconditional GO while these workflow/access/sync/metric defects or critical coverage gaps remain. Later Stage 9 certifies one frozen release; Stage 10 issues nine lane verdicts.


## 19. Stage 3 delivery sizing revision — 2026-10-02

The owner requested that the oversized navigation/design task be split. Task C is now a parent scope with five execution tasks C1–C5. A, B and D retain their existing scopes, producing eight proposed execution tasks in total. No Replit task IDs are assigned by this revision.

The consolidated specification Section 10 now contains exact delivery boundaries, source-finding slices, dependencies, acceptance/handoff evidence and staged cutover gates. C1 establishes ownership/components; C2 migrates daily sales; C3 Prospecting/Campaigns; C4 Merchant Operations/Reports; C5 Administration/Resources and final shell cutover. A/B retain backend authority and workflow repairs; C tasks integrate these rather than duplicate them. D verifies the combined serving build after each preceding task has already passed its own checks.

Coverage remains 26 Stage 3 entries plus 69 reference-audit entries, 95 traceable source entries in 14 repair groups. Original dispositions, code anchors, route/panel inventories and closure obligations are preserved. The 146 route patterns and 309 observed panel entries are inventories, not unique screens or functional passes. Splitting C adds no findings and closes none.

The interactive Liberty preview is a design draft using sample data. Its local navigation, notes/tasks/drafts and shared sample counts are not production verification. No source code, runtime setting, GHL switch, outbound gate, provider job, role or production record was changed by this planning revision. Outbound stays paused; safe GHL data sync remains an independent repair requirement. No new live audit or CI certification is claimed.

Next implementation order: agree A/C1 contracts → relevant B contracts and C2 → C3/C4 → C5 guarded shell cutover → D integrated Stage 3 verification. Stage 9 release freeze and Stage 10 lane verdicts remain separate. Update this ledger and the consolidated specification after each task/audit; merged is not closed without the required runtime receipts.


## 20. GHL repair follow-up — 2026-10-02

Fresh repo main: 07898f15d242a8e75aae4aef7ad89b223c7912b9. GHL repairs: 2b276db and 7e9b8425b6ab61c454b59b9a8d8f315bd0dd4d68. Public health now reports the latter SHA, production environment, builtAt 2026-10-02T16:51:26.540Z and publishBuildId 7d09a107-0a12-41ac-9f36-06b6d7f04757. That serving commit is accessible in fetched history; the earlier source mismatch is historical for the old build. Health alone does not prove import/worker completion or pause/control settings.

The current incoming contact repair is one-way GHL → Liberty database: preserve nonblank values, fill missing details, add identifiable unmatched contacts, exact ID/email collision checks, leased/hash/idempotent preview/apply and a local-only no-echo writer. It does not update GHL records, qualify recipients or establish canonical business links/consent. Native-workflow review is not an incoming-read/local-import prerequisite. Separate optional provider-write controls exist but must not be enabled merely to meet incoming requirements.

CRM3-03 is source-remediated with runtime closure pending. CRM3-04 is partially source-remediated; the broad healthy label is replaced with a health-probe label and timestamp. REF-008/009/069 receive qualified follow-up dispositions in the report. GHL runtime fencing improves the GHL slice of CRM3-20 but does not verify SFP enrichment. R06 metric denominators/backlog eligibility, semantic mappings, REF-003 create behavior and native/later-lane claims remain open. No finding is fully runtime-closed from this source review.

Six focused suites rerun and passed: capability policy, truth utilities, inbound sanitization/identity, incoming route guards (42 middleware + 5 input checks), isolated runtime boundary and incoming UI static states (10 checks). Used available dependencies, test mode and a nonworking localhost database URL; no production/provider writes or worker activation. No migrated disposable DB was available for integration certification. No full CI/build or signed-in live browser check is claimed.

Section 12 of the consolidated specification owns the detailed source trace, revised dispositions and exact remaining proof. Task A now verifies/reconciles the implemented incoming flow rather than rebuilds separation. C5 reuses the new components and separates Incoming contact updates / Optional GHL writes / Outbound communications. D verifies production actual counts, durable fields and no echo/send/enrollment. All 95 source entries and 14 repair groups remain; eight execution tasks remain. Original sections 18–19 observations are historical where Section 20/Report Section 12 supersede them.


## 21. Stage 3 current live/source verification — 2026-10-02

Stage 3 remains **OPEN / NOT CERTIFIED**. Current report Section 13 supersedes conflicting older Section 18–20/baseline dispositions. Reviewed main 74c15805a5cbdb3e0a82183c8c56104999075671; serving SHA 4cd62b589cef10a773909414aebe9e71d164dfd8 is accessible, content-equivalent to HEAD, built 2026-10-02T20:12:06.875Z; publishBuildId 88034800-7804-4deb-8a1a-be20a2c279fd. The earlier inaccessible serving-source finding is superseded for this build, but private lockfile install fails current npm ci. No Stage 9 freeze or release certification.

**22 distinct confirmed repair causes** are documented with current source destinations, specific evidence, exact repairs and task mapping. This is a bounded confirmed register, not a final unique-defect count across every composite claim. All 26 Stage 3 +69 reference rows (95 source entries), 14 repair groups and eight tasks A/B/C1–C5/D remain. New repair causes: incoming GHL pagination failure, consent event-kind mislabeling, Knowledge source-list invalid Drizzle call, workflow create/update/run management-role omission. Sequence FK deletion and report join multiplication are reproduced using actual methods/SQL on disposable fixtures. Notification target-resolution and fixed sequence runtime copy sharpen prior reference claims.

**Verified repaired:** Provider Results click/deep-link/reload selects its actual panel; CRM3-08 navigation slice closed. Current incoming GHL control is Enabled, outbound Paused, proposal auto-send Hold for Review. One-way incoming separation and health-probe wording are observed live; do not rebuild them or globally unpause. Current persisted incoming run b9289cb4-c35e-4930-925a-f66ff03a08a2 failed after reading 3,994 with GHL_INBOUND_PAGINATION_INVALID and 0 actual updates/additions. Successful durable import/webhook receipt/no-echo remains open.

Actual contact archive/restore persists with two audit receipts; governed disposable test-class deletion snapshot/preview/execute succeeds with idempotent retry and production-class denial. Those prove actual components/handlers, not all production UI actions. Workflow Edit/Cancel, contact search/menu and selected tabs work; no production Save/Delete/Run/activation was submitted.

All 40 previously unresolved reference entries now have individual current dispositions and attempted evidence checks in report Section 13. Native GHL sign-in did not complete; native profile/token/campaign/channel/historical opportunity claims remain blocked. Historical cleanup/identity fixes require exact immutable IDs and receipts, not population-count guesses. Composite partial rows remain qualified; no assertion that all 40 or every tab/button/role/mobile flow was verified.

Focused GHL/inbox/consent tests pass; separate disposable tests reproduce counts/schema/query/guard/FK defects and prove safe contact lifecycle handlers. Audit-only public dependency directory and PGlite current-schema fixture were used after stock install failed. Node/runtime differs from declared supported versions; no full canonical migration, stock CI, build, native PostgreSQL concurrency or live role suite certified. No repository source/lockfile modification, merge, deployment, provider send, enrollment, purchase or production purge.

Keep 11 proposed destinations and exact Liberty design tokens/layout contract; retain C1–C5 delivery split. Amend A for pagination and workflow authority, B for actual handlers/consent/knowledge/notification/sequence policies, C3 for runtime count/truth, C4 for actual financial semantics, C5 for diagnostics/error states. D must prove final actual serving build with real roles, protected durable UI fixtures, mobile, degraded cases, same-scope metrics and no-send/no-echo receipts. Stages 1–2 remain recorded completed; no later lane certified by this audit. Update ledger/report after each task and audit.


## 22. Stage 3 Task A/B master prompts and current-source preflight — 2026-10-02

Created two master Replit preflight+build prompts grounded in a fresh clone of main 74c15805a5cbdb3e0a82183c8c56104999075671 and current handler/authority/CI source inspection. Serving health has changed to 1fe28bc0d1ff9ad86e777c96b67902701f159fd8, built 2026-10-02T21:40:33.861Z, publish ID a17e3a59-81fe-4ad6-80ab-0b2b27b8ec61; reported commit fetch fails not our ref. Prior 4cd62b source equivalence is historical, not current certification. A must reconcile current Replit serving source/lockfile/build receipts; safe reviewed source work continues with explicit provenance limits.

Task A owns reproducible lockfile/CI, shared contact/task/report authority, cold-lead and workflow authorization, sequence aggregation/manager read, financial truth and existing incoming pagination/no-echo repair. Task B consumes A contracts and owns durable tasks/briefing/routing/SLA/notifications, readiness/inbox drafts, consent/privacy request states, recoverable contact/sequence/campaign/ticket/user lifecycle, relationships/workflow consumer actions and actual Knowledge SQL/error repair. Full UI/navigation/token rollout remains C1–C5; native/historical/integrated obligations remain D/later stages. All assigned confirmed/partial/unverified/disproved/upgrade/history rows retain individual proof requirements and exact owner boundaries.

Prompts: LIBERTY_STAGE3_TASK_A_PREFLIGHT_BUILD_MASTER_PROMPT.md; LIBERTY_STAGE3_TASK_B_PREFLIGHT_BUILD_MASTER_PROMPT.md. Both contain current-source VFC tables, kill lines, scope/files/implementation steps, rg checks, guarded PostgreSQL/Redis/session/actual-handler tests, desktop/mobile action readback, stock CI gates and mandatory ledger/report updates. No new full CI/migration/live browser mutation/repair/merge/deployment performed. No 95-defect claim or unsupported source-status recount. Outbound remains required Paused; incoming contact sync required Enabled; actual control state was not newly re-observed in authenticated UI this authoring pass. No sends/enrollment/spend/purge permitted. Stages 1–2 remain recorded complete; Stage 3 implementation/certification remains open.


## 23. Task #2061 review against original Stage 3 authority audit — 2026-10-03

Reviewed attached Stage 3 Authority Repairs task against freshly fetched main 7fd447ada822cdd363d567e78f29b3a976714d05 and original Task A/specification. Current serving health c893360a439dbbc829a3bb6b66a11453fc41315d, built 2026-10-03T11:27:47.302Z, publish ID 6302bdac-3bd2-42be-bc7d-15008e9ed986; accessible serving/main trees equal 35a913ebfb017501a996da7c50aed257f1b8c0ce, no tracked diff. Previous inaccessible serving-source gap superseded for this build; artifact/install equivalence remains distinct.

Task scope aligned; all 33 original A parent rows retained, zero missing parent IDs, not 33 unique defects or all 95 verified. Retain newer GHL parser/no-echo, single numeric-path middleware, manager-owned read restriction and workflow schema/no-invented-owner qualifications. Real strict lock-policy inspection fails eight policy checks (4 private-host/4 HTTP, two per resolution). Pure pagination/source assertions pass; local-only fetch transport fixture follows 302. Node 24/npm 11 audit is supplemental, not supported stock CI; no full DB/Redis/session/browser mutation/source fix/merge/deploy performed. Replit clean-install/SRI receipt claims remain supplied and unrerun here.

Five bounded amendments: supply canonical report/ledger; A adopts shared task predicates in actual backend readers while B owns UI/AI/workflow; explicitly repair SequenceReport hardcoded pause/SMTP statements; fix false replit_direct enrolled accounting and action-before-tag authority; reject unvalidated incoming HTTP redirects with actual fake-service fixtures. Details and copy-paste addendum in LIBERTY_TASK_2061_REPO_AND_ORIGINAL_AUDIT_REVIEW.md. No new tasks/defect totals or C navigation scope expansion. Keep outbound Paused, incoming Enabled/no-echo and proposals Hold for Review; controls not newly authenticated-observed. Apply addendum, build same #2061, then update ledger/report with real gates and source-fixed/tested/merged/deployed/live outcomes. Stage 3 remains open; original 95 findings and all later owners retained.

## 24. Stage 3 A intermediate workspace implementation — 2026-10-03

**Stage 3 OPEN. Task A INCOMPLETE / NOT RELEASE-READY.** No merge, deployment,
production DDL, sends/enrollment, provider spend, native writes, cleanup or worker
activation. Outbound Paused, incoming independently Enabled/no-echo and proposals
Hold for Review remain required policy; disposable incoming tests did not change
real controls. No repaired live/runtime control certification is asserted.

Receipts/commands/contracts/changed paths:
`.local/tasks/liberty-stage3-task-a-execution-receipts.md`. Supported Node22.22.0/
npm10.9.4 stock public-registry install, real-lock strict source policy, focused
actual session/DB/incoming-service/render fixtures, typecheck/build and manifest
validation pass. Security audit FAILS seven high Tailwind-chain findings
(GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm includes public latest braces3.0.3); stock static CI separately
previously failed the baseline SFP assertion `assertPaidBudgetAuthorized`. The user
confirmed paid approval and paid limits were intentionally removed. The stale
expectation now checks their absence, retaining activation/reservation/dispatch
checks; the focused source suite passes all 21 assertions. No runtime paid gate or
limit was restored; complete stock jobs remain uncertified. No major package
downgrade/migration or policy exception was silently applied. Both full stock jobs,
exhaustive A gates and repaired deployment provenance remain pending.

All original 95 findings/evidence qualifications remain above. This table retains
the 33 original A parent IDs individually; none is a blanket composite closure.
Expanded outcome/proof and remaining owners are also appended to the exact
supplied canonical specification, not substituted by an older audit.

| Original A parent | Workspace outcome / bounded proof | Remaining obligation and owner |

| REF-017 | Incoming/manual/webhook observation separated; no native workflow IDs guessed. | A owner labels; D/Stage 4 approved dependency inventory. |
| REF-018 | Production/synthetic-QA filters preserved; no production cleanup/current historical-count assertion. | A exhaustive class/archive fixtures; B users; D historic/live census. |

| REF-041 | External/local stage counts not forced equal; no mapping guessed. | D native semantic approval/Stage 4; A unmapped-label browser proof. |
| REF-046 | Old6,471/superseded UI not current denominator; scoped source only. | A object/event metric labels; C2/C4; D current view. |

Assigned subclaims: REF-016/V18 SMTP/global pause/reason unknown/error static proof
is partial A evidence, not cap/delivery closure (A interacting UI; D/Stage4 actual
delivery; C3). REF-056/V22 workflow role/ID/zero-run session fixture PASS is not
complete executor/security readiness (A remaining cases; B editor; Stage9).
REF-037/038/065 native deletion/restore and REF-064/067 actor/time/before-after
history remain D-owned and unverified. No composite findings or later stages
have been closed by these workspace tests.

## Latest Task A ledger update — 2026-10-03

**INCOMPLETE / NOT READY FOR REVIEW OR RELEASE.** Focused source tests do not
override failed stock CI/security or missing production/native/history evidence.
All 95 original finding IDs and their qualifications remain; the 33-parent
dispositions below supersede only the earlier intermediate A update.

Receipts: `.local/tasks/liberty-stage3-task-a-execution-receipts.md` and
`.local/tasks/stage3-a-final/`. HTTP = actual password-session/CSRF/DB authority
handlers and contact/related-deal lock races; TASK = adopted backend task and
same-clock static-fixture cross-reader proof; SEQ = actual DB/owned-manager/error
reads; FIN = >5,000 full-population forecast/missing-value fixtures; CREATE =
registered writer/request faults and concurrent replay; GET = actual fake-service
incoming/redirect/timeout/429/checkpoint/lease/epoch/webhook/no-echo proof; UI =
typed renders plus signed-in desktop/phone viewport in existing desktop-view mode.
These are receipt labels, not new findings. Native mobile queues are unverified.

### Final scoped A handoff correction — 2026-10-03

User-confirmed implementation/focused-certification closure; no further unrelated
legacy test repair. **NOT RELEASE-READY:** full stock integration/server checks
remain failed. No deployment or live/Stage 3 certification. Preserve all original
95 findings and composite B/C/D/later-stage ownership. These individual corrections
supersede only the outdated cells of the preceding 33-parent A matrix; all other
rows and qualifications remain unchanged.

| Original A parent | Final A outcome / receipt | Remaining owner or qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM3-01 | Implementation committed at 255d25bbbf6d014ed34a18ca5e46aae0be1278df; isolated typecheck/build/inventory/redacting scan PASS. | D/platform repaired serving/install/live proof; full CI remains blocked. |
| CRM3-02 | Supported public install, strict real-lock policy (939 fingerprints), API census, security (zero high/critical; 7 moderate/1 low), static 57/57 and writable-build 1/1 PASS. | Full integration fails at CR-06 Redis reservation; server fails at New-Lead Enrollment Policy B9/B22/B23. No full-CI or baseline-equivalence claim. |
| CRM3-11 | Same-clock scalar and actual session list/facet/cache/export population parity PASS; approved owned/unassigned scope preserved. | C2/C4 presentation; D immutable native census. |
| CRM3-17 | Manager owned-positive/global-and-other-denied PASS; signed-in read failure explicitly unavailable, not zero. | B lifecycle; no comprehensive work-queue UI claim. |
| CRM3-20 | Incoming observations distinct from explicit unavailable legacy GHL/enrichment/SLA/communications owners and native mapping; 27 permutations plus unavailable-read PASS. | D/Stage 4 actual fleet observations, not inferred consumption. |
| REF-006 | TASK/scalar and actual session list/facet/cache/export parity PASS; different populations named. | D native same-scope linked IDs. |
| REF-015 | Explicit unavailable legacy owner UI/render proof PASS; disposable Redis is not production queue-health proof. | D production Redis/worker observations. |
| REF-017 | Manual incoming/webhook facts distinguished; native mapping/legacy owners explicitly unavailable, never guessed. | D/Stage 4 native inventory. |
| REF-041 | Native mapping proof explicitly unavailable in diagnostics; no stage parity/semantics inferred. | D approved native IDs/semantics; Stage 4. |
| REF-046 | Scoped scalar/list/facet/export/cache populations tested; censuses distinct from performed-action/event claims. | C2/C4 workspace; D current-view receipt. |
| REF-052 | Focused role/session/CSRF/denial and signed-in reporting browser proof PASS; full server-required job FAILED separately. | B lifecycle; Stage 9 universal auth/2FA/deactivation; full-CI release blocker. |

Receipts and exported-contract/path handoff:
`.local/tasks/liberty-stage3-task-a-execution-receipts.md`, final scoped section
and `stage3-a-final/handoff-*`. Existing original A rows not listed in this
correction retain their individually qualified outcomes, not blanket PASS.
Outbound remains Paused; incoming independently Enabled; proposals Hold for Review.
No production deployment/DDL, real send/enrollment, native write, provider spend
or held-intent release was performed.
