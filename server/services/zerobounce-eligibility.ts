/**
 * Canonical ZeroBounce eligibility predicates + helpers (task #1540A).
 *
 * Extracted from server/routes/contacts.ts in #1541 so the durable BullMQ
 * campaign worker can share them without importing the whole route module.
 * server/routes/contacts.ts re-exports everything here to preserve existing
 * import paths (including scripts/test-zerobounce-batch-filter.ts).
 *
 * #1533 changed contacts.email_status default from 'active' to 'unvalidated'.
 * Every filter that selects contacts needing validation MUST use these
 * constants — do not hand-write the predicate anywhere else.
 *
 * Task #1956 step 6: this is the legacy campaign-engine ZeroBounce path's
 * eligibility gate — the one confirmed live-spend gap with no DBPR
 * exclusion. DBPR_LINEAGE_EXCLUSION_CLAUSE uses the canonical predicate from
 * server/services/dbpr.ts (never a hand-rolled `%dbpr%` check).
 *
 * IMPORTANT SQL scoping note: the fragment below is embedded inside a
 * correlated NOT EXISTS subquery against canonical_source_links, which has
 * its OWN `business_id` column. A bare, unqualified `business_id` reference
 * here would be resolved by Postgres against the innermost FROM-list (the
 * subquery's own table), silently shadowing the outer contacts row and
 * making the exclusion match/no-match every contact identically regardless
 * of its actual lineage. Every call site embedding this clause MUST alias
 * the outer contacts table as `c` (i.e. `FROM contacts c WHERE ...`) — the
 * fragment is hardcoded to reference `c.business_id`, not a bare column.
