/**
 * Sunbiz → canonical-business bootstrap (Task #1956, Step 2).
 *
 * Materializes real `businesses` rows from hot/warm Sunbiz entities through a
 * bounded, previewable batch. Idempotency rests on a durable claim keyed by
 * the Sunbiz entity's stable source identity (filing_number), enforced by a
 * DB unique index (sunbiz_bootstrap_claims_filing_number_unique) — NOT on
 * advisory locks, business-name matching, or generated business IDs alone.
 *
 * Every materialized business gets a canonical_source_links row
 * (source_system='sunbiz', source_type='sunbiz_entity', stable_key=filing
 * number) preserving lineage back to the originating Sunbiz entity.
 *
 * This module is intentionally wired only to the governed admin route. It is
 * not wired to any cron/worker or scheduled tick; every invocation is bounded
 * and requires the route's typed confirmation gate.

 * Executes a bounded batch. For each candidate:
 *   1. Attempt to durably claim the filing_number via
 *      INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (filing_number) DO NOTHING (or reclaim a failed
 *      or stale-abandoned claim). If no row is returned, another run already
 *      holds a live claim on this entity. The claim row's own `claimed_at`
 *      (returned by the claiming statement) becomes this executor's lease
 *      fencing token for every subsequent write.
 *   2. Only once claimed, call resolveOrganization() (transactional,
 *      advisory-locked) to either match an existing business or create one.
 *   3. Finalize inside a transaction that FIRST re-locks the claim row with
 *      `WHERE claimed_at = <lease token>` — i.e. a compare-and-swap on the
 *      lease, not just a plain filing_number match. If a second executor
 *      reclaimed this filing (because this executor stalled past
 *      STALE_CLAIM_MINUTES) and already finalized it, the fenced re-lock
 *      finds zero rows (claimed_at no longer matches), so this executor's
 *      resume cannot overwrite the winner's terminal status/business
 *      association — it reports "lost_lease" and writes nothing. This is a
 *      fencing-token pattern, not a plain filing_number keyed update: every
 *      finalize path (success, deferred, failure) uses it.
 *
 * Never call this against the full ~250K hot/warm corpus in one invocation —
 * `limit` bounds the batch. Not wired to any scheduler; caller-invoked only.
 *
 * Known residual limitation: resolveOrganization() itself runs OUTSIDE this
 * fencing transaction (it has its own transactional/advisory-lock semantics
 * that this module does not control). If this executor loses its lease
 * during the resolveOrganization() call, a business row it creates can be
 * left orphaned (no lineage, no claim association) rather than silently
 * duplicated or corrupting the winner's state — the fencing check still
 * prevents the previously-reported bug (a stale executor overwriting a
 * live winner's terminal status). Losing a lease requires stalling past
 * STALE_CLAIM_MINUTES mid-batch, which is rare in practice for a
 * caller-invoked, small (<=25) bounded batch.
