 *     — partner-referral: contact MUST have partnerType AND partnerOrgId set
 *     (add further specialized guards here for future families)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: a sequence that includes SMS steps but also lists `warm_no_pewc`
 * in `eligibleConsentTiers` MUST allow warm_no_pewc enrollment.  SMS steps for
 * non-PEWC contacts are skipped at worker Gate (b) at execution time.
 * This function must NOT over-block on channel presence alone.
