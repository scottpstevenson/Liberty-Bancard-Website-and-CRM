/**
 * sfp-campaign-packages.ts
 *
 * Task #2001 (Defects 3/4/9/10): immutable, versioned five-package
 * (vertical -> campaign+sequence) mapping, plus the explicit
 * preview/apply/verify configuration-convergence command that performs the
 * one-time Dental split / Retail / Auto-Repair narrowing / five-sequence
 * creation. Campaigns and sequences are always resolved by NAME/logical
 * identity here, never by hardcoded numeric ID — those IDs are ordinary
 * serial keys and are not guaranteed stable across environments.
 *
 * This module never writes to sequence_enrollments, campaign_queue_*, or any
 * GHL/outbound table. `lifecycleState = 'current'` on a package version means
 * only "this is the current SFP vertical-to-package mapping" — it is a
 * reference/version authority, never an approval or send authority.
 * campaign_approvals and CR-06 remain the only applicable approval
 * authorities, unchanged by this task.
